<p>Does it mean your pooch is going to die if you do not get him the treatment? Parvo in cats can spread to other cats, but can’t infect other species. Whilst the chances are very slim, new scientific research from the last decade suggests that cats can get parvo from dogs. People who handle an infected cat or an infected cat�s bedding, food, or water dish can carry the virus to the next cat they handle. Also, dogs and cats cannot get parvovirus b19 from an infected person.</p>

<p>Cats can get parvo directly from contact with another cat who has it. Cats, both wild and domestic, are the only host that the parasite requires to complete its life cycle. Puppies under 6 weeks of age retain immunity from their vaccinated mother. They can also get it from contact with an infected cat�s urine, feces, and nose secretions. Studies have shown that shelters take in a greater percentage than vet clinics of adult animals without.</p>

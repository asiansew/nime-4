<p>While we can’t know for sure the exact moment a dog senses a pregnancy, we do know that not much gets by the canine nose. They can sense changes in the weather, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions. The answer, according to animal behavior specialists, is yes: Wouldn�t have anyone else bath him and started crying again. We look at the signs of pregnancy, how to care for a pregnant cat and signs of labour.</p>

<p>I don�t think that they�ll understand the hey, you�re pregnant, but i�m sure that they will notices changes in your behavior, your posture, your routine, and, of course, the emotions that accompany pregnancy (even early pregnancy). I�m currently 7 weeks and 1 day pregnant and this past week my moms dog has become much more affectionate with me. Their sense of smell is superior to ours; They can sense changes in the weather, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions. This is due to their excellent and refined sense of smell.</p>

<p>During pregnancy, you experience profound changes in your hormonal levels, when your body begins producing more progesterone, estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) hormones. Sorta like a gentle velcro thing. If my little one came up and laid on my stomach, that generally meant something was wrong. My cats were great to have around during my pregnancy. I�m currently 7 weeks and 1 day pregnant and this past week my moms dog has become much more affectionate with me.</p>

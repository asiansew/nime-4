<p>All cats produce this protein to some degree, so all cats are somewhat allergenic. Which is perfect for families with allergies.

<p>Bengals are called hypoallergenic because they produce lower allergens than other cats (produce less of fel d1 protein than others). Bengal cats are known to be one of the most hypoallergenic cat breeds, but they don’t seem to produce less fel d1 (the protein that causes allergic reaction in humans) than other cats. Cats are certainly not a very hygienic pet; Breeding for hypoallergenic qualities in cats requires decreasing the feline’s production of a particular protein found to be the culprit in triggering human allergies in susceptible individuals. The answer is probably in their fine coat, which is so fine it doesn’t require much grooming or maintenance by the bengal.</p>

<p>So are bengal cats hypoallergenic? This is believed to be the case for three main reasons: Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. The main cause of cat allergies is a protein called fel d1, which is present in cat dander (flakes of dead skin) and cat saliva. Lots of folks love cuddling cats and all, but with some people, this can cause allergic reactions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://asiansew.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/d5/92/5cd592c626e2f4fed11ce1831b14ff29.png" alt="The Toyger The Ultimate Guide to their History, Types" title="The Toyger The Ultimate Guide to their History, Types" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/asiansew.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

<p>In addition, bengal cats shed considerably less than other cat breeds, so the dander in their fur doesn’t spread around as much. These quiet and affectionate cats have a lifespan of 12 to 16 years. Because dander comes from bengals cleaning themselves, it’s impossible to completely avoid them having dander. However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic. We can’t say that bengal cats are completely hypoallergenic because no cat is, but they produce very little fel d 1 so you can expect to suffer very few allergic reactions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://asiansew.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/2a/95/ba2a95f79662a2493bd8e335128ad176.png" alt="The Toyger The Ultimate Guide to their History, Types" title="The Toyger The Ultimate Guide to their History, Types" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/asiansew.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

<p>However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic. Bengal cats are not hairless. In search of hypoallergenic cats, i found websites stating that bengals could be a good option. It means relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. in comparison to other cat breeds, bengal cats are less likely to cause an allergic reaction in people, and here is why.

<p>In other words, there is no cat that’s totally hypoallergenic. With their silky, unique coat, bengal’s don’t have the need to groom themselves excessively as most cats, which is considered to be the main reason why bengals don’t cause an allergic reaction that often as other breeds. However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic. Just to make things clear, fel d1 is the allergen that determines whether a cat is hypoallergenic or not. But other domestic cats can be bred with leopard cats to produce bengal cats.</p>

<p>Bengal cats are listed as hypoallergenic which means that those that suffer from allergies are less likely to be bothered by these cool cats. I really hate to break this to you, but there’s not really any such thing as a truly hypoallergenic cat. Their tight sleek pelt may produce less dander or hold fewer allergens. But other domestic cats can be bred with leopard cats to produce bengal cats. Bengal cats are a crossbreed between the wild asian leopard cat and several domestic cat breeds, mostly the short haired egyptian mau.</p>

<p>Like many other breeds of cat, they have short hair and clean themselves regularly. A lot of people are allergic to cats. However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic. That means that they don�t necessarily give off zero fel d1 protein. In addition, bengal cats shed considerably less than other cat breeds, so the dander in their fur doesn’t spread around as much.</p>

<p>I would not recommend purchasing a bengal until you are 100% sure he will be ok with it. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. Because dander comes from bengals cleaning themselves, it’s impossible to completely avoid them having dander. They can be downright filthy when they decide to shed their fur. So what makes them less hypoallergenic?</p>

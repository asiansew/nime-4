Ngc 6543 is a planetary nebula in the draco constellation.ngc 6543 is situated close to the northern celestial pole and, as such, it is visible for most part of the year from the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>This nebula�s dying central star may have produced the outer circular. The cat’s eye is one of the most structurally complex nebulae known. This nebula�s dying central star may have produced the outer circular. To some it looks like a cat�s eye. Imagine an equilaterial triangle with these two stars as the base, and the third point of this triangle shows the location of ngc 6543.</p>

<p>The image from hubble�s advanced camera for surveys (acs) shows a bull�s eye pattern of eleven or even more concentric rings, or shells, around the cat�s eye. It was formed around 1,000 years ago when a hot, bright central star expelled its outer envelope. The cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) is a young planetary nebula in the constellation draco, midway between delta and zeta dra; The hubble space telescope has observed about 100 of these objects, starting with the cat’s eye nebula in 1994. This image reveals new details of the cat’s eye nebula (catalogued as ngc 6543), one of the most complex planetary nebulae ever seen.</p>

<p>To some it looks like a cat�s eye. The full beauty of the cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) is revealed in this new, detailed view from nasa�s hubble space telescope. The cat’s eye nebula was discovered by william herschel on february 15, 1786. Zooming on the cat�s eye nebula hubble observes the sky in the direction of the constellation of draco (the dragon) where the cat?s eye nebula is located. As rough guide, the location is located in the constellation of pisces.</p>

It is quite rare to find a female tabby kitten with an orange colored coat. This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats. Well, that’s not entirely true.</p>

<p>#1 orange tabby cats are usually male. The stripes on the body of these cats can be easily and rightly compared to those which are present on the body of tigers. It can also occur at just about any age from kitten to adult. The four basic tabby patterns are due to two distinct gene loci (the agouti gene locus, with two alleles, and the tabby locus, with three alleles) and one modifier (spotted, with two alleles). Tabby is not a cat breed.</p>

<p>Therefore, breeders usually charge a higher price for the female orange tabby cats. Much like the comparison of male cats to female cats, it all depends on the factors surrounding their upbringing and breed. In fact, up to 80 percent of orange tabbies are male, making orange female cats a bit of a rarity. The orange tabby cats also known as “orange tabby ” have a coat in many different colors of red, orange or even golden yellow. Mama says she’s seen a lot of female orange tabbies.</p>

<p>Your first statement is incorrect. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. In some places, the cost of a female tabby cat even doubles up the cost of the male ones. Personality varies from cat to cat, having little to do with coat pattern or color. The majority of the orange tabby cats are males.</p>

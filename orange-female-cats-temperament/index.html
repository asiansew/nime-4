<p>Although orange tabby cats are primarily male, female orange tabbies do exist in a ratio of about 80 percent male to 20 percent female, according to arnold plotnick, dvm. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. This finding suggests that orange cats may enjoy greater reproductive success in particular social conditions. Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern. On the other hand, calico cats are far more likely to be female than male.</p>

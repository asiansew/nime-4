<p>When older cats begin to lose their hearing, they often meow loudly at night in order to hear themselves, similarly to when an elderly person starts to lose their hearing, they begin talking louder. Loud, frequent meowing becomes more common as cats age. Your cat is meowing at night is your cat meowing at night reasons reasons why your cat meows at night is your cat meowing at night reasons.

<p>When older cats begin to lose their hearing, they often meow loudly at night in order to hear themselves, similarly to when an elderly person starts to lose their hearing, they begin talking louder. It can really drive a person insane. Cats communicate many things using meows, whether they’re playing, calling to kittens, asking for food or complaining about a dirty litter box. If their vision and hearing becomes impaired, it can be harder for older cats to maneuver around at night. Don’t quietly (or loudly) curse at your cat through your door, don’t talk, don’t sigh;</p>

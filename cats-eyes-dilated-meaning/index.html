The pupil is the black slit/circular shape in the middle of the cat’s iris (the coloured part of the eye). When reading a cat’s eyes, be sure to keep several factors in mind. Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right.</p>

<p>Cats dilate their pupils when they stare at their prey and prepare to attack. Pain in the eyes themselves is usually accompanied by the constricting of a cat�s pupils, while pain elsewhere in the body can be accompanied by dilated pupils. In bright light, your pupils constrict (get smaller) to prevent too much light from entering your eyes. This is a clear sign of fear and fear, which can be caused by a change, a loud noise, a situation, etc. Thankfully, such toxicity is rare in felines.</p>

<p>Her pupils become heavily dilated, and her eyes appear wide. The reason that the eyes are dilated is because your cat is effectively blind. Your cat could also be sick. Glaucoma is another common cause for differing pupil size in cats. Diseases such as kidney or thyroid disease can cause hypertension leading to blindness.</p>

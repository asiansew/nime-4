<p>Again, this is not always the case. Strangely, blue eye white cats tend to be deaf even more than others. The condition most commonly affects white cats, but may be found in a cat of any color, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene. White spotted cats are rarely deaf and the once that are are mostly high grade white but i guess low grade white spotting can cause deafness id the white spotting runs over the ear. A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance.</p>

<p>Epistatic gene, commonly referred to as dominant white, is the gene that produces white cats with blue, orange or odd color eyes and this mutation is most closely related to deafness. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. It�s also best to keep a partially deaf or fully deaf cat indoors at all. The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye. This cat is characterized by its curly hair, which is the product of a genetic mutation.</p>

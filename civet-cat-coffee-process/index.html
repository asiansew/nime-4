<p>It may feed on beans from the arabica coffee plant, the robusta, or any other coffee plant available to it. Civet coffee beans, as mentioned, used to be picked from the poop of civet animals who were wild and free. After the civet excretes the berry in its feces, humans collect the dung, which is then washed so as to extract the berries, which are then ready for roasting and preparation as a beverage. Most of the species diversity is found in southeast asia. Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.</p>

<p>The coffee separated from its faeces is processed to make the kopi luwak. Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it’s made from excreted arabica beans. Kopi luwak coffee is the world�s most expensive coffee. During this process some kind of unique fermentation occurs which is responsible for giving the civet coffee its special flavor. It has been proven that this special coffee has medicinal properties as well.</p>

<p>However, its processing is very unusual. Kopi luwak is literally what it means in indonesian — coffee obtained by collecting civet’s excrements after they have. It has been proven that this special coffee has medicinal properties as well. A civet (/ ˈ s ɪ v ɪ t /) is a small, lean, mostly nocturnal mammal native to tropical asia and africa, especially the tropical forests.the term civet applies to over a dozen different mammal species. During this process, the enzymes found in the civet’s stomach alter the flavour of the bean, making it richer, smoother, and more earthy with chocolate.</p>

<p>The civet selects the ripest berries of the coffee plants from the old robusta coffee plants and eats the whole fruit. Having noticed this phenomenon, some frustrated farmers decided to wash the beans and roast them. Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. During the digestion process, the bitterness of the coffee is removed. The reality is that connoisseurs all over the world expect to be able to enjoy their cup of civet cat coffee whenever the mood moves them.</p>

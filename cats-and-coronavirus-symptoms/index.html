<p>It is important to note that feline coronavirus (fcov) is not associated with the current coronavirus pandemic. In cats with the strain of feline coronavirus that can cause fip though, there are more severe symptoms. Cats can catch the new coronavirus from humans, according to a report released monday by the u.s. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is one of the leading causes of infectious death in young cats. Although this virus is nearly identical to the fip virus, cats who were infected with it developed only very mild diarrhea and recovered easily.</p>

<p>Here are some veggies that are safe for your cat to eat in small doses: Supervise cats when eating raw turkey bones or necks. Is it ok to occasionally feed my cat lunch meat? Duck meat is also safe but is higher in fat, so it should be fed more sparingly. You may have even noticed that most canned food and kibble has turkey as an ingredient!</p>

<p>As we mentioned at the beginning of this article, turkey is a very common source of protein in both dry and wet cat foods. Supervise cats when eating raw turkey bones or necks. Along with cat can food and dry ,food human food like turkey breast,fish (no bones),ham,beef,chicken. Parboil raw chicken meat to kill off any surface bacteria. Remove uneaten turkey after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In fact, it is a common ingredient in many commercial dog and cat foods. So, the bottom line on if cats can eat turkey? Chicken flesh on its own is unlikely to cause your cat any harm—after all, they are carnivores whose bodies are designed to process uncooked meat—but the chicken we buy at supermarkets is often so contaminated that it poses a serious poisoning risk. First, feed any turkey scraps in moderation, so your cat doesn’t have an upset stomach. This is the only time that a cat should eat this meal.</p>

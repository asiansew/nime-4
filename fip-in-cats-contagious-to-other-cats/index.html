<p>Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other. Do i need to isolate him from my other cats? Feline coronavirus is highly contagious but the mutations themselves are not. Overall, up to 90% of cats have positive coronavirus titres. The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus.</p>

<p>Dogs, humans and other species cannot be infected. Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other. Many of the clinical signs of fip are vague and occur with other diseases found in cats. It is also one of the most complicated diseases known to veterinary medicine. It is important to note that while fecv is quite contagious (it is passed in the feces and saliva of infected cats and infects other cats primarily via the oral cavity), fipv is not believed to be.</p>

<p>Caring for a cat with fiv is much the same as caring for any other cat; Typically a cat with dry fip will show ocular or neurological signs. And may explain the uncommon epizootics of fip where a number of cats in the same environment develop fip within a days or weeks of each other. A contagious disease is spread from animal to animal or person to person. Some cats can have the corona virus their whole lives and it will never mutate into fip, others are not that lucky.</p>

<p>Fip is short for feline infectious peritonitis. Chylothorax is more common in cats than dogs. The mutated virus is not shed by the cat, so while fip is not actually contagious, the more benign feline coronavirus is contagious to other felines. Newer findings from around the world (2). It is a contagious virus, with the majority of its cases observed in multifeline households, catteries, and shelters.</p>

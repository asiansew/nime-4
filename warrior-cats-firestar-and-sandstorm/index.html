He also finds his sister and starts to meet her. &gt;.&gt; it was always simply a wistful thing. The warrior code is danger of being washed away by a river of blood, and all the young cats� strength will be needed if the clans are to survive.</p>

<p>Takes place during �the last. Takes place during �the last. The warrior sandstorm, has moved to the nursery.

<p>Eventually they became warriors together, and dustpelt was a crush on sandstorm, and he�s so snarky to fireheart since sandstorm loves him, and not dustpelt. He also finds his sister and starts to meet her. Firestar and sandstorm make it to skyclan�s camp, where they meet an old cat named sky, the last cat alive keeping skyclan�s memory. Resents having firepaw in the clan, because he was once a kittypet other names: Takes place during �the last.</p>

<p>Sandstorm said, and gently licked his cheek with her tongue. Firestar padded through the crowd of mingling clans, leaped up the trunk of the great oak, and sat on the branch beside mistystar. After becoming a warrior, sandstorm grew closer to fireheart and mentored sorreltail. When the morning comes, he decides to go with them, saying goodbye to his. But what if the fire that was destined to save the clan was exiled?</p>

<p>When twolegs destroyed the forest, he led his clan on the great journey and helped them settle into the lake territories. Mocked him as a �kittypet� sided with dustpaw, who obviously likes her way more than firepaw when fireheart became a warrior before her, she was jealous and resentful. She was in a clearing, and there were shadows of leaves dappling the ground. Skywatcher asks firestar to rebuild the clan, and firestar, feeling forced to say yes, obliges. The warrior code is danger of being washed away by a river of blood, and all the young cats� strength will be needed if the clans are to survive.</p>

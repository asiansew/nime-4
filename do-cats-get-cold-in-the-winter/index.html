Many cats tend to be chronically dehydrated, and winter’s chill can make it even more difficult for feral or outdoor cats to get access to water. Just like humans, cats are different from one another. If you want to leave your cat outside in winter then it’s important you have a place or somewhere that your cat can take shelter in.</p>

<p>Apart from taking in a homeless cat and giving it a forever home, or asking us or the rspca to catch and rehome the cat, here are some ideas that can make the life of a cat in winter a little less harsh: Cats seek relief from most of the same cat cold symptoms as we do, including watery eyes, a runny nose, fever, sneezing, loss of appetite and a feeling of lethargy. Cats suffering from illness are also extra sensitive to this. The best thing you can do is put out water for them and check it twice daily to make sure it hasn’t frozen over. Be particularly gentle with elderly and arthritic cats during the winter.</p>

<p>Like humans, cats suffering illness often have low defences and are more likely to catch a cold with low temperatures. We must provide them with extra protection against the cold. Some cats are more sensitive to the cold and others do not agree with summer at all. Other risks for cats in winter. But the tolerance power of cat for cold and heat is not the same for every cat, some are extra sensitive and the older cats feel extra cold;</p>

<p>Many cats enjoy watching birds from windows, for example. The heating pad will hold heat from the warmth of your feral cat and there is enough room for their food which. The cool winter weather not only impacts our lifestyle, it affects our feline friends too. The average indoor cat eats around 15% more during the winter months. In a sense the domestic cat does get a winter coat because he/she sheds fur in the late spring because there is more light and in the fall (autumn) as the days grow shorter, the coat thickens up for winter.</p>

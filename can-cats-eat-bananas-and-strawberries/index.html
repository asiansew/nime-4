<p>Dogs are omnivorous, which means that they require a combination of animal and plant material to have a healthy, balanced diet. If you are hesitating to feed your cat strawberries, i am very pleased to say: Hence, don’t feed them with strawberries. A few other recognizable edible plants include the christmas cactus, cornflower, marigold, gerber daisy, petunia, rose, sunflower, venus fly trap, and zinnia.

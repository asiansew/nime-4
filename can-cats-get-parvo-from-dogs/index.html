<p>Yes, kennel cough is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from a dog to a cat. The most common strain of canine parvovirus in north american is strain 2b (mochizuki et al., 1996). Interestingly, we have our own strain of the parvovirus called parvovirus b19. We, however, can be carriers of the disease. Dog parvo is one of the few viruses that dogs can pass to cats.</p>

<p>In a matter of days, a perfectly healthy puppy can go from playful and active to fatally ill. That is, a canine parvovirus will affect dogs, wolves, and foxes, but will not infect cats. That’s because canine parvovirus types 2a and 2b are similar to the feline parvovirus. The parvovirus in dogs is also very closely associated with the herpes virus panleukopenia: Can dogs get parvo from cats?</p>

<p>This is partly due to the fact that adult dogs have more robust immune systems than puppies do, but it is also because most adult dogs have been vaccinated against the disease. If your cat gets parvo, mortality rates are high, but prompt veterinary care will increase her chances of survival. Because they lose their natural fear of predators, this may make them easy prey. Since cats can get kennel cough from dogs, it is very important to isolate a dog that has been diagnosed with kennel cough. However, there are some studies that have shown that a mutated strain of the canine parvovirus (cpv) can, in fact, infect cats.</p>

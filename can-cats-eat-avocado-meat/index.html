<p>If your cat does eat some avocado or even the leaves, the bark, or the stem of the avocado tree, you need to get your cat to your vet instantly. Milk can be a safe product for many cats but some adult cats are lactose intolerant, so any dairy product may cause diarrhea. Like coconut oil, avocado oil can be a healthy addition to your cat’s diet (we recommend this brand). Here are some veggies that are safe for your cat to eat in small doses: This means avocado meat or flesh is great for providing energy for your cat as well as the essential components to help organs function and build muscle.</p>

<p>The answer is yes but avocado snacks should be administered still with precaution. Milk can be a safe product for many cats but some adult cats are lactose intolerant, so any dairy product may cause diarrhea. Though avocado is extremely rich in nutrients, you have to be careful how much you feed your cat due to the high fat content. The avocado pulp is the greenish fruit meat that we eat. In fact, there are special foods and supplements for cats that contain avocado oil.</p>

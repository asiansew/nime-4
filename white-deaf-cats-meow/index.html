A cat who was found as a stray, gave birth to seven little kittens on valentine�s day. We know he has vocal cords since we have heard him let loose when he is gotten in skirmishes with our other cats.</p>

<p>According to the aspca complete guide to cats, 17 to 20 percent of white cats with nonblue eyes are deaf; In the wild, meowing is used in a limited capacity because making a lot of noise isn�t exactly conducive to hunting. Of these, white cats have the highest risk of deafness. There are links between genetic research being done in cats and deafness in humans. Is it possible he feels inadequate or insecure because of his inability to meow?</p>

<p>My veterinarian said white cats are often deaf. I was lonesome and couldn’t. I am lucky to have two deaf cats who control their volume pretty well, because some deaf cats can be very loud. If you are considering adopting a deaf cat it�s important that you know that this could be something you�ll have to live with. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes.</p>

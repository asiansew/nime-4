<p>The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light. Diseases such as kidney or thyroid disease can cause hypertension leading to blindness. Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause. Regarding to my cat�s dilated pupil the vet found it working well, since with the flashlight test both pupils were contracted. In the day a cat�s pupil (the black part) is really small because their eyes are made for excellent night vision.</p>

<p>Routine blood tests should always be run to check for concurrent or underlying diseases such as kidney disease. If you have a cat with one dilated and one is not, there are a number of things that could be wrong. The most serious of these are feline leukemia, toxicity, dysautonomia or tumors. If your cat’s eyes are big and round and their pupils are the size of pinpricks, it means they are preparing to attack a perceived threat. Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause.</p>

<p>But the thing that really fascinates a lot. Constricted pupils can indicate your cat is agitated or angry. Our zebulon�s pupils never close to a slit like normal cat�s pupils do in bright light. Your cat�s pupils sound consistently dilated, which can be a sign of her losing her eyesight. She seems to be in no pain at all.</p>

<p>Also, his pupils are almost round all the time. My cat miss kitty usually follows along. Constricted pupils can indicate your cat is agitated or angry. Diseases such as kidney or thyroid disease can cause hypertension leading to blindness. Is he taking any medications?</p>

<p>When you adopt a barn cat, you agree to give them: (a municipal pet license may be required) if you are interested in adopting a barn cat, or have questions, contact <a href="mailto:backyardbuddies@thehumanesociety.org">backyardbuddies@thehumanesociety.org</a>. Animal humane society can help place healthy cats that aren’t suitable as pets in environments where they can flourish, working alongside humans to control rat and mice populations. Barn buddies are available for no fee and are spayed/neutered and vaccinated before being placed. All barn cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and available for $25.</p>

<p>These cats are fixed, vaccinated and are currently available for adoption only as barn cats. Our working cat program is designed to find homes at barns, warehouses, farms and other safe locations for cats that have traditionally been. If you don’t see an animal that meets your needs, please check back regularly as we are always getting in more cats looking for loving forever homes. We occasionally have cats available for adoption that just want to be outside. Most cats prefer another cat companion.</p>

<p>To help your new barn cat acclimate to his/her new surroundings we encourage you to plan to keep him isolated in a small area within your outbuilding initially, with no access to the outdoors. They are perfectly content chasing mice or hanging out in a barn… Barn buddies are available for no fee and are spayed/neutered and vaccinated before being placed. By providing a safe shelter and daily food and water you can help these cats have a permanent home, in turn, they can help you by keeping the rodent population down. All cats will be fully vaccinated, spayed or neutered, tested for felv/fiv, and microchipped.</p>

<p>Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. In fact, it can cause a series of ailments, including an upset stomach, cramps, and severe diarrhea. “we generally recommend that cats be fed no more than 20 to 30 calories a day from unbalanced sources, such as human food. However, even kittens don’t deal that good with cow milk, so they should avoid drinking cow milk the same as adult cats. I’m sure there are many more reasons too.</p>

<p>The traditional image of a contented cat lapping from a bowl of milk is a misleading one. The nutrients found in the milk of the kitten’s mother is most suitable for development.

Will all cats have an adverse reaction?</p>

<p>But, did you know that milk is actually not good for most cats? According to purina senior nutritionist jan dempsey, “cats generally lose their ability to digest the sugar found in milk after weaning because solid food takes its place and they no longer need this ability. Some say that cats lack the ability to process lactose and are therefore intolerant to milk products. “we generally recommend that cats be fed no more than 20 to 30 calories a day from unbalanced sources, such as human food. As with humans, a cat�s digestive tract is constantly changing and in turn modifying the production of certain enzymes (depending on the food).</p>

<p>Cat parents, however, are questioning the benefits and risks of goat’s milk because dogs &amp; cats aren’t created equal and it’s believed that milk is bad for felines. What was not to like about this rich and vaguely sweet substance? Although many people believe that milk is good for cats, the reality is that it�s a myth.

<p>Some say that cats lack the ability to process lactose and are therefore intolerant to milk products. While veterinarians agree that milk is not a full meal and should be given as a treat only, there�s no consensus on how much milk is safe for cats. Raw goat’s milk is all the craze in the pet nutrition world right now. One saucer of milk is a lot for a cat, and a high fat content can lead to our feline friends becoming a bit more ‘cuddly’ than may be healthy for them! That’s why you shouldn’t use milk as a replacement for your cat’s meal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://asiansew.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/a6/ee/67a6ee6b96fb993c4e1a71c061d2b786.jpg" alt="Mmmm&amp;hellip;. milk and cookies!

<p>Drinking milk is also a way to provide water for cats. Since cats don’t have the enzyme necessary for digesting lactose, drinking milk can lead to gastrointestinal issues such as an upset stomach, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight. Cats can absorb vitamins and calcium in milk. What was not to like about this rich and vaguely sweet substance? Not all adult cats are lactose intolerant, but many are.</p>

<p>If your cat seems ok after having a saucer of milk, and there are no signs of vomiting, diarrhea, or discomfort, it’s a good sign that it’s fine as an occasional treat. Cats probably first developed a taste for cow�s milk from hanging out in dairy barns, where milk was a coveted treat. My cats love the whiskas brand, but actually just throwing a piece of their regular food seems to be just as good. But milk is not a natural part of an adult cat�s diet, and in some cases it�s not good for them. They may rub against your leg when you pull the milk carton out of the fridge or demand your cereal milk.</p>

<p>A couple of tablespoons is plenty. Just serve a bowl of cereal and leave it at your fingertips. One saucer of milk is a lot for a cat, and a high fat content can lead to our feline friends becoming a bit more ‘cuddly’ than may be healthy for them! When serving milk to your cat, don’t overestimate the portion size. To be able to digest dairy milk, cats have to be ‘equipped’ with an enzyme known as lactase enzyme.</p>

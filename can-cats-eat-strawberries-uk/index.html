<p>However, too much vegetable matter in a cat’s. We are also often asked whether tortoises and other turtles can eat strawberries, raspberries and other berries. There is a consensus on this fact with various sources including saveafluff.co.uk, rabbit.org and rabbits.life all agreeing on the issue. Fruit contains a lot of sugar, so cats should only eat them in small amounts. Bunnies can eat all types of uncooked berries.</p>

Dogs can eat strawberries, too — but only in moderation, and with the right preparation! These root vegetables produce one of the best dietary sources of vitamin a and are also rich in fibre, vitamin c and b6, potassium, calcium and iron. Allowing your rat to eat vegetables and fruits on a regular basis is very important for its diet.</p>

Cats can eat strawberries, despite having little nutritional value to them. You should ask for advice from the vet before giving anything new food to your kitten. Cats can get the same health benefits from apples as humans do.</p>

<p>In moderation, cats can eat strawberries. The stems and seeds should be avoided. Strawberries contain a lot of sugar, and a cat’s digestive system doesn’t necessarily process sugar quickly or efficiently. According to aspca (american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals), this refreshing fruit is not toxic to cats.however, there are still some important things to consider when offering your cat this amazing treat. But for kittens and younger cats is different.</p>

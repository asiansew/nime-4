<p>This, combined with their small size, makes them very dangerous for dogs. Chicken necks and wing tips are the most suitable bones for cats. What cats can’t eat turkey? Cats and turkey bones aren’t an honest combination. Avoid feeding them the skin and bones, and don’t use any seasonings.</p>

<p>Additionally, turkey necks are rich in glucosamine and chondroitin, which are both known to support the joint health and mobility of dogs. Fresh, lean, roasted turkey breast is the best way to feed turkey to your cat. Raw meat, whether it comes from a turkey or any other animal, can be risky because it might have been exposed to feces, bone marrow, and blood, and all of these can contain bacteria and other germs. Bones should be raw, as they do not splinter as often as cooked ones do. A splintered chicken bone can rupture your cat�s throat while he swallows, damage his stomach and intestines, and possibly lead to his death.</p>

This can cause your cat to choke, and the last thing you need on thanksgiving is a trip to the emergency vet. Cats can eat turkey, but make sure that the turkey you feed them is cooked and fresh. And cats can eat raw chicken bones. Always trim turkey for dogs and cats away from the bone!</p>

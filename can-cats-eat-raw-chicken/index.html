<p>We’ve already discussed why cats should not eat raw fish, but what about raw chicken? Cats can eat chicken breast, thighs and necks. The reason for this is that most cats cannot tolerate eating cold foods. Chicken flesh on its own is unlikely to cause your cat any harm—after all, they are carnivores whose bodies are designed to process uncooked meat—but the chicken we buy at supermarkets is often so contaminated that it poses a serious poisoning risk for our cats. Chicken, fish, beef, and turkey are common.</p>

<p>Cooked eggs are safe for cats to eat, and are a great source of protein to add to your cat�s diet. This prevents the juices from. The raw chicken bones on the other hand are really good for them and their stomach can easily handle them. The cottage cheese in this recipe should not be used in abundance as it can lead to gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea. There are some foods which are not beneficial for cats to eat.generally diary products are one of them, thanks to the feline inability to break down lactose.</p>

<p>Some cats can be ‘fussy eaters’, which can develop when they are fed the same food (such as raw chicken) over a long period. However, as with all foods, you must ask your vet first and follow a few guidelines. Chicken, fish, beef, and turkey are common. Keep reading for the details. Just keep it in reserve as a temporary diet choice.</p>

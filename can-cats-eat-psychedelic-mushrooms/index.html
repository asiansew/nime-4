<p>A california lawmaker wants the state to decriminalize possession of magic mushrooms and other psychedelics as part of an agenda to ratchet down the war on drugs. Dogs have sweet receptors, too. Hopefully this goes without saying, but your cat should also not ingest psychedelic mushrooms or recreational drugs of any kind, as these can be very harmful.

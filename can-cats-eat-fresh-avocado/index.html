<p>Studies suggest that cats and dogs can experience mild stomach upset from eating leaves, bark, avocado skin, etc., that contains persin. Remember though, overconsumption of any food is not particularly good for you or your cat. They find the fatty, creamy taste yummy and delectable. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it is super for your cat. Avocados are really healthy for us and we used them for about 5000 years in food, skin oils and as fresh treats.</p>

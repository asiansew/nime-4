Reports of this condition date back to at least the 1930s (bamber, 1933), and many investigators have studied it in. The variable penetrance of deafness and eye colour may be caused by interplay with other genes and/or environmental factors.</p>

<p>White cats with blue eyes had a high probability. Cats with completely white fur often have blue eyes. The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye. Why are white cats with blue eyes usually deaf? About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear;</p>

<p>It is a myth that every white cat is deaf, or that white cats with blue eyes, green eyes, or one of each are always deaf. It has to do with a genetic trait in all white cats. A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. Do white cats with blue eyes go deaf. Following are the species of black cats with blue eyes that you might want to have a look at:</p>

<p>If 40 percent of these cats are deaf, it means the majority (60 percent) can hear. Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; Cats with just one deaf ear may appear perfectly normal, and their problem may never become known to their human companions. Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article).</p>

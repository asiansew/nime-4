<p>Do cats snore while awake? The vibrations and snoring are most common when the tissues of the upper airways are relaxed while sleeping. Your cat is probably purring in their sleep because they are comfortable. It’s this round shape that enables the cat to retain maximum heat, thereby having a comfortable and peaceful sleep. If you notice your feline friend snoring every once and a while, it’s probably nothing to be concerned about.</p>

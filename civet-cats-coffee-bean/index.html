<p>As a solution for the unsustainable and inhumane treatment towards civet cats, a vietnamese coffee brand partnered up with a team of german scientists in 1996 to study the effect of the civet cats on coffee and duplicate a natural enzyme soak process that would approximate the same effect. At my local specialty coffee bean store, it sells for $420 per pound—or $10 for a 10 oz. But cat poop coffee — that is, civet coffee (or kopi luwak, as pronounced in indonesian) — is real, and really expensive. The worst part is people are buying it not knowing how viciously these animals are handled in order to produce this luxurious coffee bean. In the digestion process of the civet cats, the cherry goes through the digestive tract, only removing the skin and the pulp leaving the beans undigested.</p>

<p>From there, the coffee is then produced and manufactured like any other coffee bean. Civet dung, studded with partially digested coffee beans, used to be collected from the wild. According to world animal protection, the cats are poached from the wild and kept in cramped barren cages to produce gourmet coffee for visiting tourists. Firstly, the palm civet that produces the kopi luwak can eat different types of coffee. It’s an exotic delicacy called kopi luwak, made from coffee beans found in the droppings of the indonesian civet cat.</p>

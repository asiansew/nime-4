<p>It�s possible that certain breeds of cats won�t cause such a strong reaction. We have no idea how the idea that the russian blue cat is hypoallergenic got started—but it wasn’t from russian blue breeders. We are active loving families, with passion for hypoallergenic kittens especially for russian blue, sphynx and siamese. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. The russian blue cat breed is known far and wide for its beauty.</p>

<p>That’s because they produce the least of the fel d 1 protein unlike any other cats. But, i have found out about these �hypoallergenic cats�, which produce less fel d 1, or don�t shed as much. This cat breed produces less fel d 1 glycoprotein, a secretoglobin protein that is produced in a cat’s sebaceous glands and saliva and is the primary allergen in cats and kittens. They still produce a small amount, however, which can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the person. She may be a good choice for pet parents with allergies because she doesn�t shed much and produces lower levels of the glycoprotein fel d 1, a known allergen, than other cat breeds.</p>

<p>Allow this list of “hypoallergenic” cats to be your ultimate guide as you search for your perfect match! Some are born bald, or with a straight coat. Siberian cat together with balinese one are considered to be the most hypoallergenic cat breeds in the world. However, this does not mean that they will not trigger allergies since no cat is 100 % hypoallergenic. In texture the coat of the russian blue cat is very different from any other breed and is the truest measure of the breed.</p>

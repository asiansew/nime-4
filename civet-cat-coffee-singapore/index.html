<p>How the kopi luwak coffee beans are created. The smell of the bean was earthier than other coffee which sometime has strong fragrance as a result of roasting butter. Taken at singapore zoological gardens. Most of the species diversity is found in southeast asia. Due to such exclusivity, a pound of it costs between us$100 and us$600, easily making it the most expensive coffee in the world!</p>

<p>Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it�s made from excreted arabica beans. Unfortunately, most producers of this type of coffee keep the small animals, which we affectingly know as toddy cats, locked up in cages. After swallowing the coffee berries, the cat digests the flesh and pass out the coffee seeds with the excrement. In fact, they are more closely related to mongooses than they are to cats. Well, the coffee is brewed using my krupa coffee machine.</p>

<p>The word “kopi” means “coffee” in balinese, while “luwak” is the local name for the palm civet. This little creature eats the coffee beans, partially digests them and then excretes them to produce the renowned (but at that time, banned in australia) �kopi luwak� or civet cat coffee. This coffee berry had it�s seeds eaten by a civet cat. �kopi luwak� is a type of expensive gourmet coffee made from coffee beans that have been �processed� by a civet cat. Civet cat was an unexpected visitor that caused a din in singapore home.</p>

<p>Civets are commonly known as ‘musang’ in the malay language. What does civet cat taste like? Bearing the face of a raccoon, the ears of a cat and the tail of a monkey, this species is also called the toddy cat for its apparent fondness for fermented palm fruit, which is used to make palm wine or toddy. A wild civet eats ripe arabika coffee beans at a plantation which produces luwak coffee on the indonesian island of bali. Our luwak coffee ingredient is only sourced from ethical plantations where the luwak coffee is produced by wild civet cats.</p>

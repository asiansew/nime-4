<p>Big cat rescue corp., also known as bcr and previously known as wildlife on easy street, inc., operates an animal sanctuary in hillsborough county, florida, united states, which rescues and houses exotic cats, and rehabilitates injured or orphaned native wild cats. Many arrived in poor health. Over 200 big cats are housed on 108 acres (0.44 km 2). The efrc is the focus of several books published by indiana university press including saving the big cats (2006) and tails from the exotic feline rescue center (2016). You can meet some of our adoptable cats there!</p>

<p>A recent post on the park�s website said the animal rescue is losing $160,000 a month in tour revenue. Indiana is home to the nation’s second largest big cat rescue center, a rural clay county facility that houses more than 200 animals. We do not have a facility, and all our dogs are placed in personal foster homes. Devos will use �bully pulpit� to urge school reopenings. 34,905 likes · 1,686 talking about this · 3,261 were here.</p>

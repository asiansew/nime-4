<p>25% of white cats with yellow eyes have normal hearing. Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. While this could be true to some extent, it doesn’t make black and white cats that much different from other cats of the same breed.

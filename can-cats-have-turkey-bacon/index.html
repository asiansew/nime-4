Turkey bacon has almost none of the vitamins found in roasted turkey meat. The reason for this is because turkey bacon is a leaner meat than pork. I have a boston terrier and i give him the bb thin slice turkey bacon as a treat and he is good.</p>

<p>Say no to stuffing, which can have onions, garlic and spices, all dangerous to your pet. Pork is safe for cats to eat, although ham and bacon should be avoided. If regular bacon is too high in face, can cats have turkey bacon instead? Processed meats like bacon and ham are popular among us humans. Bacon comes from pigs but curing bacon takes a lot of salt which is unhealthy.</p>

<p>They don’t have as many taste buds as we do, and therefore bacon won’t taste the same. Is turkey bacon any better than pork? Some brands of turkey bacon may even have more sodium than regular bacon. Just like humans, the biggest concern about bacon for cats is the extremely high amount of salt. The short answer would be no, it’s not okay to.</p>

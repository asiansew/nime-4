<p>Deafness is more likely to occur in white cats with blue eyes; Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. Albino cats are prone to eyesight issues, but aren�t prone to deafness. In fact, albino cats usually have light blue eyes and extremely white fur as they have no melanin and therefore no color. However, this isn�t common in cats.</p>

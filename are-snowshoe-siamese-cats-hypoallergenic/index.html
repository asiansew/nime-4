<p>The snowshoe is a somewhat recent domestic breed that was developed during the 1960s by a breeder of siamese cats.its body type is considered to be a moderate oriental or foreign type, modeled after the appearance of the old style of siamese that is often now called a victorian or an “apple head”. However, they are experts at training their humans to suit their needs and wants. When their siamese side kicks in, they will always lead the way during walks. While the snowshoe is a distinct breed, the cats are still sometimes bred back to siamese or oriental shorthairs to maintain their traits. The paws are white, which gave this breed its unique name.</p>

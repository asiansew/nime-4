Orange cats do not belong to an independent cat breed; Orange cat breed lovers can find the american bobtail in various shades of ginger, while they come in white, black, blue, and fawn colors as well. This cat is characterized by its curly hair, which is the product of a genetic mutation. Within their calico spots, they may have tabby stripes.</p>

<p>Think of tabby as a coat type. Are they their own breed? I used to have 5 cats; They are, however, cats that can be found in any breed. Any breed of cat can be a marmalade as long as it is reddish, yellow, or orange in color.</p>

<p>Also called torties for short, tortoiseshell cats combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches. Is a white cat with orange spots the same as an orange/white tabby? You’re unlikely to find two calicos with the same patterns or patches on their coats. I used to have 5 cats; The selkirk rex is a cat breed from the united states, 1988.</p>

<p>Felines always eat the liver of their prey. Turkey breast, wings and legs, cut into chunks. How to feed your dog liver liver for dogs. Neither male nor female cats should eat a diet heavy in liver or other organ meats. Just bear in mind that cooked, plain turkey meat is the safest for cats and dogs in general.</p>

<p>It is worth seeing if you can find a source of chicken giblets for cats, because they are a great way of providing the vital “organ” part of a raw food diet for your cat.and of course they come in a really convenient size that is easy for your cat to eat, so there is very little preparation involved for the owner. Some tuna now and then probably won�t hurt. Another hidden danger of feeding turkey to pets is the ingestion of cooking twine, which many people wrap their turkey in and can cause intestinal obstruction when eaten, especially by cats. Cats can be addicted to tuna, whether it�s packed for cats or for humans. And, too much tuna can cause mercury poisoning.</p>

<p>If your dog or cat is not typically raw fed, i wouldn’t recommend starting with raw liver. Liver from chicken, beef, pork, or lamb are all good choices for your dog. Cats can eat chicken breast, thighs and necks. But a steady diet of tuna prepared for humans can lead to malnutrition because it won�t have all the nutrients a cat needs. Cats in particular needs taurine, so you may give them the turkey heart, liver and other dark meats.</p>

<p>Cats become infected after they ingest the virus when they groom or eat. I have had it happen with one of my cats when she was young. Very few cats that contract coronavirus end up developing fip, but those that do may not show signs for months or years after the original coronavirus infection. Sharing litter boxes is a major route of transmission of coronavirus between cats. Even house cats can develop fip, either because they came in contact with it from their mother as a kitten, or sometimes from another indoor cat that never develops symptoms.</p>

<p>So a positive “fip test” may point towards a diagnosis of fip but also may not. So a positive “fip test” may point towards a diagnosis of fip but also may not. Two types of disease exist, although there can be a crossover between the two: Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a viral disease in cats which carries a high mortality due to its characteristic aggressiveness and nonresponsiveness to fever, along with other complications. Sadly, feline infectious peritonitis is a very difficult disease to both diagnose and treat and even indoor cats that have been fully vaccinated can develop the condition.</p>

<p>The mutant feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv) that causes the disease is generally not considered to be contagious among cats. Cats catch fip by coming into contact with the saliva or feces of other infected cats. There are no unique signs of fip and they do vary. Nonetheless, in cats that have signs of fip, very high elevations of fcov would be seen as supportive evidence of the diagnosis. The coronavirus is spread through direct contact via the nose and mouth with infected feces.</p>

Fip is caused by an inappropriate immune response to a common virus, which is called feline coronavirus. Unfortunately, routine blood testing for feline coronavirus is not clinically useful. Fip may be more common in certain breeds and breeding lines, such.</p>

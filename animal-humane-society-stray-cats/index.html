<p>Since taking over animal control services for san diego and several other cities last year, the san diego humane society has allowed more than 1,200 stray cats to be released back to the streets. Our next clinic is 12/6/20: Stray cats and feral cats share the same basic characteristics in that both are cats that do not have an obvious owner, who wander around the neighborhood without a human. All feral cats brought in for surgery must be in individual raccoon size traps. Who would like a cat to help with pest control and/or keep farm animals company.</p>

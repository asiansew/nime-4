<p>And finally, feed your cat turkey meat that does not have seasonings or added ingredients. Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple. The new cat we have brought in is smokey and about 10 years old (i think) anyways i was in the kitchen about 3 days ago get some lunch and i open the turkey by mistake and a piece dropped on the floor. Turkey can be sold whole, in parts (like legs or breasts), as cold cuts, or as ground meat. Lunch meat isn�t healthy for us either.</p>

<p>So, the bottom line on if cats can eat turkey? In fact, it is a common ingredient in many commercial dog and cat foods. I am going to add fish to this list, while it is okay to give a small amount of fish to your cat, it should be a sometimes food, and not a regular part of his diet. Dogs are sensitive to onions, garlic and salt, the smaller the dog the higher the risk. Its not healthy for them.</p>

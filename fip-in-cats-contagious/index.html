<p>Fip is caused by the mutation of the corona virus, which is highly contagious, as in passed through the litter box, food/water bowls, etc etc. Feline infectious peritonitis, also known as fip, is a deadly viral disease of cats. There seems to be a lot of controversy over whether or not fiv in cats is contagious, and how it may be spread. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv). Fcov is a very contagious virus and such prevention does require rigorous hygiene.</p>

<p>Peritonitis, or inflammation of the abdominal cavity, is only one feature of this systemic disease, which can cause ocular inflammation. Feline infectious peritonitis is a very special reaction to infection with the feline enteric coronavirus. The benign, or usually harmless,fecv lives in the cells of the intestinal tract and is shed in cats’ feces. Identifying the signs and which cats test positive for fiv allows cat owners to take precautions to help these cats lead longer, healthier lives. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip), which is caused by a contagious virus, can cause significant illness and death in cats.</p>

<p>What is feline infectious peritonitis. The contagious nature of the disease makes testing for fiv important. Cats with weakened immune systems, such as those infected with feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus, are also at risk. Cats are showing clinical signs compatible with fip; Feline infectious peritonitis (fip), which is caused by a contagious virus, can cause significant illness and death in cats.</p>

<p>“no wonder kids grow up crazy. Cat’s cradle can be thought of as an eschatological book—that is, one that is specifically about the end of the world. The meaning is unclear, but many sources speculate that it is a reference to a popular children’s game: Notable for its black humour, it is considered one of the author’s major early works. Something intricately or overly complex and/or elaborate.</p>

<p>Cats cradle is one of the oldest games in recorded human history, and involves creating various string figures, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. Cat’s cradle is a remarkably discursive book, full of loose ends, unexplained events, and characters who appear in focus for a moment only to vanish without apology. A cat�s cradle is nothing but a bunch of x�s between somebody�s hands, and little kids look and look and look at all those x�s…. [and] no damn cat, and no damn cradle. However, as i looked further into vonnegut’s story line and investigated the deeper meaning, i realized that he was challenging the reader to think of the bigger picture:</p>

<p>Well, science has given us the power to end all human life, both in reality and in the book. As you are reading, it doesn�t take long to start reflecting on life, hope and the future. The true origin of the name is debated, though the first known reference is in the light of nature pursued by abraham tucker in 1768. For each quote, you can also see the other terms and themes related to it (each theme is indicated by its own dot and icon, like this one: Newt’s painting was a representation of the cat’s cradle and should not be confused as the actual cat’s cradle.</p>

<p>The theme of the cat’s cradle is used throughout the book to represent many of the truths, as viewed by vonnegut, that are found in society. The novel features two notable inventions: An international journal in english 2.1 (2011): “no wonder kids grow up crazy.

<p>Vonnegut employs humor as a means to make his reader assume a critical stance toward the sacred cows of their culture. There is no truth, there is no meaning, “no damn cat, and no damn cradle” (66). The new healthcare legislation is a baffling cat�s cradle of regulations, requirements, and loopholes. Despite the fact that the father is constantly putting off quality time with his son, the son sees his father as a role model and a fine example of who he wants to grow up to be. From this, we can assume the book we just read is the history of human stupidity bokonon suggested.</p>

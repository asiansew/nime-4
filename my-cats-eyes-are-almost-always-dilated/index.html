I�m sure many of you have experienced a lasting interest in a condition when a cat I can barely see the yellow. In cats, as well as humans,have drainage channels that, if blocked, cause the aqueous humor to accumulate.</p>

<p>She seems to be in no pain at all. Hi, mil�s cat has its pupils constantly dilated even during the day (we live with mil for the moment), the house is quite dark but it is sunny today and still all black pupils. Otherwise they are almost as big as her irises. My cat miss kitty usually follows along. This change may be described as a “film” covering the cat’s eye or as an increased cloudy “whiteness” to the cat’s eye.</p>

<p>When i turned to check on miss kitty, i happened to look at her eyes and noticed that her right eye is completely dilated. Cat’s eyes will always dilate periodically. In these instances, your cat’s eyesight is eventually at risk. She went on to tell me that he�s always super hyper, always has dilated eyes and thin. A cat�s eyes are very expressive and can tell you a lot about her mood and health.</p>

<p>Today, while i was walking my dog; She went on to tell me that he�s always super hyper, always has dilated eyes and thin. But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings. Most often, a cat will only have a cataract in one eye. The cat�s eyes are probably responding to the brightness, rather than the quality of the light.</p>

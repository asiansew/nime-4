One fully crushed eggshell can provide up to 800 milligrams of calcium*, which is enough for two meals. Cats need protein in their diet, and if you’re tired of feeding her commercial cat food, or if you just want to give her a special treat occasionally, then eggs are a great option.</p>

<p>If you decide to leave a bowl exclusively of eggshells, your birds will eat them as and when required. Your cat can eat egg yolks, but they should be cooked first. Not only can dogs eat eggshells, but they are also an excellent source of calcium, vitamins, amino acids and other essential nutrients. They’re not toxic for your feline friends. Cats won’t eat the turtle’s shell, but cats can eat the turtle’s meat.</p>

<p>If your veterinarian says your feline friend can safely eat eggs, give it a try. Add finely crushed eggshells to dog or bird food. The shell of an egg is a perfect source of nutrients that your dog might otherwise find in bones from animal carcasses (if your pooch still lived in nature, of course). The best way to feed eggshells to your cat is to grind them into a fine powder that you can mix in with their food. Given all of those health benefits, you may wonder if cats are allowed to eat eggs.</p>

<p>How long do you bake eggshells for chickens? Eating and playing with turtle eggshells could damage the turtle eggs. If you really want to give them the nutritional benefits of egg shell without all the risk, you can try an egg shell powder supplement for pets, such as eggshellent calcium , which can simply be sprinkled on your cat’s food. Although cats are known to be finicky eaters, most cats enjoy eating eggs. Eggs are full of nutrients and can safely be fed to cats.</p>

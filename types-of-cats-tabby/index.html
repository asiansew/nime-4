<p>The tabby pattern is in the form of darker spots. There are various types of tabby cats, each possessing a unique coat pattern. The spotty tabby shows off their distinct round spots against a background of lighter fur and might even display a faint necklace line. One of these colors will be red and, since all red cat coats are tabby, this means the sections of the coat with red patches will be tabby. The sporty looks of the gray tabby are peerless.</p>

<p>So, it is quite evident that there can be a variety of tabby cats. The forehead m tends to be more prominent, and their stripes can typically be seen on their shoulders, sides, backs. The gene for the tabby pattern can be found in all cats. Although that may the case, many people struggle to define what a tabby cat is, and as there are so many varieties, what one tabby cat may look like, may be very different from another. Tabby cats are some of the most common cats in the world.</p>

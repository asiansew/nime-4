<p>You can give these as treats, but “in general, there is no reason to use them unless the cat has developed an unusual taste for them, wynn says. Cats love the taste of milk, be that soy milk or almond milk. Your cat may beg you for it, but it would be best to make it a rare treat rather than a frequent staple. When undigested, lactose makes its way through the cat�s digestive system and takes in water from the intestines. For adult cats, treat milk replacers like any other dairy product:</p>

<p>The answer is yes, they can — but it doesn�t mean they should. This milk especially for cats is cat milk, it’s like regular cow milk, only the lactose is removed from the milk.

Your cat may beg you for it, but it would be best to make it a rare treat rather than a frequent staple.</p>

<p>In general, you should avoid giving cats whole cow�s milk or cream because of the higher fat and sugar content. Baby mammals, like kittens, produce enough lactase that they can digest their mother�s milk.but as they wean off of their mother�s milk—at four to six weeks of age, on average—and grow into adulthood, they begin to produce less lactase and lose the ability to properly digest milk. Ideally, cats should only be given water to drink. Still, they don’t digest milk or any other dairy products because they are lactose intolerant, but there is enzyme lactase in the cat children, which … read more » Cats drinking milk is typically the stuff of storybooks and movies — a child rescues a cat, and the first thing they do is feed it a shallow saucer of creamy milk.</p>

<p>For cats, temperature tolerance (i.e., at what point a cat gets cold) can vary quite a bit depending on body weight, age, hair coat, and breed. If they do wander off in search of a warm place, they’ll be easily traced back to your address; The ideal room temperature for a cat is 70 degrees fahrenheit. Kittens and older cats are most susceptible to [ 1] catch a cold in the colder climates. Like kids in daycare, kittens in pet stores or shelters are more likely to develop upper respiratory.</p>

<p>Similarly to humans, some cats may feel the cold more than others. Do sphynx cats get cold? The first thing to know is that, in cold temperatures your cat will actually feel colder.although these animals prepare for winter by changing their fur, some breeds do have shorter and less dense coats (such as the persian, siamese, devon rex cats or the sphynx that has no hair at all) and will therefore feel the cold more and will require special care. Keeping cats out of severe weather is an easy way to prevent these problems from occurring. Although cats are very well adapted to cold weathers, once it goes below freezing they can easily catch hypothermia and frostbite when it becomes too cold for your cat outside then they will go look for a warm place</p>

<p>An indoor cat will feel cold. Keeping cats out of severe weather is an easy way to prevent these problems from occurring. During periods of very cold temperatures, misty’s fragile little paws can become cold very quickly, leading to numbness. Either from illness, or from extreme temperatures. If they simply must be outside from time to time, try to keep a close eye on them.</p>

<p>In fact, a cold (or upper respiratory infection [uri]), is one of the most common illnesses seen in kittens.colds are especially common in settings where many cats live together, like pet stores, shelters and breeding facilities. Even if your cats live only indoors, the cold weather can still impact them. As science explains, a cat will automatically become slightly cooler while sleeping. When the weather is cold, sphynx cat owners should ensure that a heater is turned on. Many cats really enjoy a warm, cozy place to nap.</p>

<p>So i was wondering if having a himalayan cat would be a good idea for us. However certain breeds including oriental and siamese are less likely to cause allergic reactions. Himalayan cat purrfect breeds balinese cat siamese and cheer hypoallergenic cat breeds list with pictures hypoallergenic cats metaphorical platypus 20 most por long haired cat breeds siamese. However, the very first himalayan was the result of genetic research being conducted in the harvard medical school during the early 1930s. Often referred to as the “longhaired siamese,” the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed.</p>

<p>I know that no animal is really hypoallergenic so please don�t tell me that (no offense). The himalayan, or himmie for short, is a persian in siamese drag. It means that they produce fewer allergens. Followed by the siamese mix and siamese. Although its short hair can cause an allergic reaction, finding a lot less hair in the home really helps those people who are sensitive to feline allergens to not develop symptoms.</p>

<p>However, female cats and kittens do generally produce less of that pesky allergen. Individuals with severe cat allergies should still be cautious around siamese cats. Siamese cats are considered one of the oldest existing asian cat breeds, having originated in thailand (formerly siam). He was large and in charge, our miny panther. However, the very first himalayan was the result of genetic research being conducted in the harvard medical school during the early 1930s.</p>

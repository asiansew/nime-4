<p>Strawberries are a pleasing deal with in your cat to bask in once and a while, but they ought to now not be introduced to their normal dietary ordinary as they may be high in sugar. The leaves too can be eaten, put in a dish or used for tea so it’s no wonder that this fruit is so popular. Also, while some cats will love them, others will not, this is just a fact of nature for any other carnivorous animal. Can cats eat strawberries and become allergic? Cats do not need leaves in general as they provide no valuable nutrients that are essential for cats health.</p>

<p>However, while a single strawberry as a treat now and then isn’t hazardous for your cat’s health, feeding your cat strawberries in large amounts is not recommended. For cats strawberries don’t contain anything poisonous but they do contain quite a lot of sugar. Unless you cat has an immediate and visceral allergic reaction, strawberries are harmless. The leaves are much healthier than fruits, and they can be added to the list of leafy. If you want to make some special cat food on your own.</p>

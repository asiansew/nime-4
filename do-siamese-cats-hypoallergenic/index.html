<p>Read on to find out the truth. Are siamese cats good or bad for allergies? If you’ve ever googled around for hypoallergenic cat breeds and come up with exactly zero results, that’s because hypoallergenic cats don’t really exist—at least not breeds that are totally hypoallergenic. No cats can be completely hypoallergenic and not even the hairless cats. Seal point siamese cats the siamese is the original seal point cat that has become an important breed since ancient history.</p>

<p>Despite the long coat, siamese shed less and that is the reason it is often counted as a hypoallergenic breed. They’re not totally hypoallergenic, but they come close. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. Since there are not cats that are 100% hypoallergenic but siamese cats. However certain breeds including oriental and siamese are less likely to cause allergic reactions.</p>

<p>You might think this means more trapped allergens, but balinese cats actually produce less fel d 1 than many other breeds. Despite the long coat, siamese shed less and that is the reason it is often counted as a hypoallergenic breed. The siamese cat is not hypoallergenic. It was believed that when a member of the royal family in siam died, the siamese cat received their soul. As far as we know, balinese cats could potentially be hypoallergenic.</p>

<p>Individuals with severe cat allergies should still be cautious around siamese cats. Balinese cats are said to produce less of the most common allergen, fel d 1. Often cat breeders and online sites claim that a particular cat breed is hypoallergenic, and this type of news spread fast. So, the chances of triggering an allergic reaction are also lower in the presence of siamese cats. Due to the low production of the fel d1 protein, which is responsible for producing the allergen, that makes them a good choice for cat lovers who may face allergic reactions.</p>

This sound will usually be paired with other cat body language signs such as bared teeth, flattened ears, an arched back and their fur will also stand on end (also known as piloerection). Cats can even be territorial of areas that aren’t part of their kingdom.</p>

<p>Why do cats hiss at new kittens or cats? It doesn�t look like my little kimba cares, but smokey sems to want to get close, she just rejects them. Mother cats hiss at their kittens for a few different reasons. I have my little family, momma cat, daddy and two kittens, well they are growing up now. Why do male cats hiss at their kittens?</p>

<p>She used to hiss at her kittens and other one�. Primarily, mothers hiss so that kittens can learn to mimic the sound. I fed a million feral cats over the years and i know they reject their own kittens once they grow a bit older. I have my little family, momma cat, daddy and two kittens, well they are growing up now. Fear is a common reason that cats hiss, but it’s not the only one.</p>

<p>Cats also hiss at their kittens to warn them of an incoming threat. This is evidenced by jumpy behavior when something or someone closes the cat’s path and he didn’t see them approaching. Some experts in feline behavior believe that cats actually developed this habit by imitating snakes. I have three cats, all littermates, and the only female named tinker just had five kittens. Unfamiliar objects in the house that move strangely may trigger your cat to hiss or be fearful.</p>

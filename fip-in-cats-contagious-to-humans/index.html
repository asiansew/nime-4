<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv). Learn more about the causes and treatment of fip here. He�s been researching coronaviruses for more than 40 years. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the abdominal cavity, is only one feature of this systemic disease, which can cause ocular inflammation, neurological signs, liver problems, and fluid around the lungs.

While fip is not contagious there does seem to be a genetic component to which cats are more prone to the mutation which is why we sometimes see it in cats related to each other.</p>

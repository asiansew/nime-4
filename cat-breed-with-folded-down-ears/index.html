<p>Because most scottish folds have short, dense fur, grooming can be as simple as brushing and combing the fur once a week to remove loose hair and dead skin cells. The scottish fold’s folded ears are produced by a dominant gene that affects the cartilage of the ears, causing the ears to fold forward and downward, giving the head a rounded appearance. As a result of the gene is dominant, all scottish fold cats ought to haven’t lower than one folded ear mum or dad to. This white female farm feline had unique, folded down ears, and british shorthair breeders william and mary ross, upon seeing this unusual cat, recognized her potential as a new breed. One cat that has folded ears can carry either 1 (heterozygous) or 2 (homozygous) copies of the fd gene that causes the fold.</p>

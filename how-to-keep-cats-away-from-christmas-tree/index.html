<p>We all know cats are assholes and dogs are clumsy sometimes. I have 6 cats and each has decided whether or not they�re interested in the christmas tree. Her other ideas include putting orange peels in the tree water, as cats dislike orange. Additionally, the oils from fir trees can cause irritation to cats, so please be aware. Unfortunately, all cat owners will be familiar with the struggle of having to keep your cat away from the shininess of your christmas tree.</p>

<p>Spray the tree to keep kitty away. My dog has already knocked bulbs off the tree a bunch of times so i might just get the saran wrap out and call it a day. Always unplug the lights when you’re not able to supervise your cat. Neither cats nor dogs like the hot, spicy smell. Spraying the tree with apple cider vinegar will have the same effect on your cat or you can spray some pine cones with acv and place within the tree.</p>

<p>They’ll knock off the ornaments, make needles fall, and even topple the tree. How do i keep him out of the tree? Many cats hate the feel of foil on their paws and the loud crinkling noise it makes when they walk on it. A lot of them love messing with the tree, even climbing it. Spraying the tree with apple cider vinegar will have the same effect on your cat or you can spray some pine cones with acv and place within the tree.</p>

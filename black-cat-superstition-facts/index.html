If you�re spooked when you see a black cat, it’s probably from medieval folklore that continues to shroud the reputation of these dignified kitties. Black cats are typically associated with bad luck and halloween, am i right?</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, black cats are plagued with superstitions. Superstitious greeks then began to link black cats with death and the afterlife. 3* if a black cat comes across you in the morning, it brings you a bad luck. It is the only recognized cat breed in which black is the only acceptable color. In fact, the cat goddess bastet was part black cat and part woman, illustrating just how much black.</p>

<p>This is mostly because of their superstitious reputation. The legend of a black cat being unlucky stems from greek mythology. To contradict this bit of black cat superstition, seeing a black cat is considered good luck in some cultures. The pigmentation responsible for the black colour can break down in strong sunlight causing the colour of the fur to fade to a brown or rust like colour. This ghostly glow is the perfect backdrop to discuss the ultimate symbol of halloween, the black cat.</p>

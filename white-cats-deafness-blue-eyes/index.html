<p>Studies have shown that solid white cats with two blue eyes have 65% to 85% chance of being deaf. It is this w gene which is the most prone to causing deafness in white cats. The same genetic factors that give white cats their snowy coats and unique eye colors can also cause total or partial deafness in many kitties. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. Cats can be deaf in one or both ears. There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf.</p>
<h3 id="photography-by-belinda-pretorius--shutterstock">Photography by belinda pretorius / shutterstock.</h3><p>Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. 3 cats don’t have to be completely white to carry the gene that causes deafness. If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. So if the cat has blue eyes, it is more likely to be deaf, and if it has only one blue eye, it maybe deaf on only that side, and the cochlea in the ear on the other side will have developed normally.</p>

<p>A survey of 185 white cats reported the following results: Black and white cats with blue eyes have a much more common type of hearing and vision problem that may be related to their eye color. There are other reasons for cats being white, and also other genes which can affect eye colour. When the gene affects only one eye the cat will have odd eyes. Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing.</p>

<p>However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. Cats with blue eyes can sometimes have visual or auditory deficiencies. However, that is not guaranteed.

<p>Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. Cats can be deaf in one or both ears. So if the cat has blue eyes, it is more likely to be deaf, and if it has only one blue eye, it maybe deaf on only that side, and the cochlea in the ear on the other side will have developed normally.

<p>Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. If this is not treated early, cats will not be able to hear as well as they should be able to.</p>

<p>The white fur and blue eyes both are a consequence of a lack of melanin from pigment cells. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf.</p>

<p>There is a developmental fault in the ectoderm which results in deafness. If a white cat has only one blue eye, there’s about 40% chance of hearing loss. Albino cats (red eyes due to c gene or blue due to k gene) totally or partially white cats (due to the s gene) all white cats (due to the dominant w gene) we find in the last group, those that are white due to the dominant gene w. It is this w gene which is the most prone to causing deafness in white cats. There are other reasons for cats being white, and also other genes which can affect eye colour.</p>

There are other reasons for cats being white, and also other genes which can affect eye colour.

<p>If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. 2 cats with white coats and blue eyes are highly likely to be deaf in one or both ears. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear.</p>

<p>The prevalence of deafness is high in cat populations in which the dominant white gene is segregating. Deafness is more likely to occur in white cats with blue eyes; Pointed cats, like siamese, who have a lighter body and darker extremities, always have blue eyes. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. 3 cats don’t have to be completely white to carry the gene that causes deafness.</p>

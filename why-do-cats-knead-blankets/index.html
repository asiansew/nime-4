<p>Adding further weight to the explanation. While kneading doesn’t always yield milk, adult felines may always associate the motion with the comfort of nursing. This is also why some cats dribble when they knead; Long after they�ve left their mothers� sides, cats continue to knead. Cats have sweat glands on their paw pads that produce a unique scent.</p>

<p>During the process, the cat feels entirely contented and relaxed. In an ideal world, kittens stay with their mothers until they’re at least eight weeks old. Wild cats had to build nesting places with leaves and grass, especially after birth or a hectic day of hunting. Why do cats knead blankets? But why do they continue to knead past nursing age?</p>

<p>You might be surprised that they might even eat the leftovers of your pepperoni pizza. Animal protein is the number one key to a healthy cat. While dogs are far more likely to eat mushrooms than cats, it is advised you avoid giving your cats any type of mushrooms to be on the safe side. Mushrooms are rarely cooked without any kind of season or extra flavors, and some of the extras we use in our food prep can be very harmful for our dog. Cats need protein, but they should get it strictly from animal meat.</p>

<p>If you must feed your cat a piece of mushroom off your plate, make sure that it is cooked thoroughly and monitor them to watch for any adverse reaction. This means you could potentially share your favorite cooked mushrooms with your cat, but try to refrain. Usually chickens don’t second guess what they are eating. Can cats eat onions and garlic. The answer is that many are.</p>

<p>They certainly are not picky eaters. The answer to it is that it depends. You can use it as a treat sometimes at the max. To be on the safe side, mushrooms are not recommended for cats. Animal protein is the number one key to a healthy cat.</p>

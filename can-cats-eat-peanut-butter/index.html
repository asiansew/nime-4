<p>Peanut butter is safe to be eaten by your cats as it is not considered toxic to animals. If you are a cat owner you should already know about the curiosity of those furry animals and does it happen that you catch him getting too close to your food in the morning like peanut butter for example and you thought about to give him a try of this beauty then you stop because you don’t know if it. Peanut butter contains a high amount of trans fats, resulting in a long shelf life. Certain foods such as onions, garlic, and raisins are toxic to cat’s, but this isn’t the case with peanut butter. Peanut butter is not poisonous but it’s the cat’s digestive system that imposes this limitation.</p>

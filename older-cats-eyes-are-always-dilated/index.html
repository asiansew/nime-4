If unequal pupils occur suddenly, bring your cat to a veterinary clinic or animal hospital immediately as eyesight can be permanently damaged if the problem is not rectified. What i mean by that is they get moon eyes when they get excited. But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings.</p>

<p>There may or may not be other symptoms present. Youthful cats are more susceptible to having dilated pupils as a result of elation than much older cats and calmer cats. I had not thought much about it because it has been very gradual, but the last time i was at the vet they asked me about her eyes. Given the age of your cat i would evaluate her for pain, and treat appropriately. She has always had very striking big eyes.</p>

<p>We live in a very rural, wooded area and she had a few battle scars such as a missing tooth and one of her claws seems messed up like its always fully extended or something. It can be a sign of a physical ailment or disease if it�s a constant condition, such as hypertension, anisocoria, or dysautonomia. If your feline’s pupils are dilated frequently, then you might want to consult your vet. These drugs affect the muscle that widens the pupil, slowing how it reacts to light. There may or may not be other symptoms present.</p>

<p>I have an older female cat that just showed up at my house one day last fall. That can be a normal sign of aging, or it can be a sign of serious disease. Anyway i figured she belonged to someone because she was very fat or she was pregnant so i asked. We live in a very rural, wooded area and she had a few battle scars such as a missing tooth and one of her claws seems messed up like its always fully extended or something. To moisten and lubricate the eyes.</p>

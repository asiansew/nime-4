<p>Cats have different skill sets than dogs do but that doesn�t mean they�re not as intelligent. Feline information on intelligence comparison remains sparse because, well, cats are unwilling to cooperate. Dogs are smarter than cats and their advantage is increasing. Yet in another study, it was discovered that cats are able to follow puzzles, but unlike dogs who will seek help from their owners, cats will simply keep trying until they get it. We know that dogs were domesticated long before cats were and dogs are easier to train and are sociable more than cats.</p>

<p>“i�d bet the house that some cats are smarter than others. Accumulating statistics concerning dog intelligence is a smooth undertaking The primary reason for this is that dogs are social animals and must solve problems in their interactions with other dogs and humans. Gathering information concerning canine intelligence is an easy task but try finding the same info on cats. In fact, cats do sleep more than dogs, which makes them a much calmer influence in a house, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>Based on the number of neurons found, they speculated that dogs have roughly the same intelligence as raccoons and lions, while domestic cats have comparable intelligence to bears. Therefore, we should stop comparing the knowledge of cats and dogs, at least until scientists and pet enthusiasts find the right methods and experiments to compare dogs and cats effectively intellectually. Dogs also can be trained to a wider variety of roles. While dogs are easier to train and teach, cats are naturally more independent and intuitive. Here is a video where a cat can be seen pulling out a prank on a dog.</p>

<p>They have gone on to produce litters with a variety of markings, and they have perhaps the deepest blue eyes seen in any breed of cat. The color of mine depend on how much light there is. While pedigreed black cats have a tendency towards bold orange eyes and white cats tend to have blue eyes, there�s very little to connect coat color with eye color. Eye colors of ginger cats. Cats can have eyes of very varied colors and of varying intensity emerald green, copper orange, yellow amber etc.</p>

<p>These rare cats have strong color point markings and in the purebreds, brilliant blue eyes. Abraham.zoey on june 05, 2020: Came home one day to find an adorable, tiny kitten in my driveway. There is also the very rare ojos azules breed, which can produce cats with dark coats and blue eyes. “this is a very rare breed which appears not to be linked to any certain fur color or pattern, giving the opportunity for cats with dark coats and blue eyes,” says bennett.</p>

<p>It depends on the breed, a white cat with blue eyes may be a foreign white, khao manee, british shorthair, munchkin, sphynx, devon rex, cornish rex, maine coon, norwegian forest cat or a domestic (mixed breed). Cream is a dilution of the red (commonly called orange) gene in cats. While all kittens have blue eyes to start with, they will usually change to other colors as they grow up. The eyes change color later to the adult color, which ranges from green to hazel to orange to copper. Yellow with big blue eyes.</p>

<p>Most, however, will have gold or green eyes. The spectrum of the color they can have ranges from green, hazel, golden yellow, lemon yellow, amber, orange, copper and even mixed colors. Came home one day to find an adorable, tiny kitten in my driveway. My eyes are blue with a green ring around the iris. But if you have a red tabby kitten they may keep the blue eyes for about 2 months before they start changing to the adult color of green to gold, or a mix of both colors.</p>

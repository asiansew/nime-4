<p>There is a $35 fee to turn in owned cats, $15 for senior citizens. Sadly they have already been spending a very long time at the shelter and would benefit so much from being in a loving home. The shelters save rate is about 88% for dogs and 96% for cats. There is a $25 fee for dogs, $10 fee for cats. And sunday from 11:00 am to 3:30 pm.</p>

<p>Did you know orange tabby cats are typically male? According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names. Their coats come in 4 different patterns. Yes i do know for cetain that orange cats are more likely to be male, however there is genetic reason the cat can�t be female, it just more likely to be male. Since any red color is epistatic, all orange cats are tabbies and solid red show cats are usually a low contrast ticked tabby.</p>

<p>Yes, although the striping pattern is coded for by a completely different gene. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger, whereas males need only one. Although some red cats (usually dilutes) may appear to be a solid color, upon closer examination, you will see the pale stripes, whorls, or spots of the tabby. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby.</p>

<p>Orange tabby cats are almost always male. Also called torties for short, tortoiseshell cats combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches. Fun ginger tabby cat coat fact: Yes i do know for cetain that orange cats are more likely to be male, however there is genetic reason the cat can�t be female, it just more likely to be male. Male orange tabby cats outnumber females approximately 4 to 1.</p>

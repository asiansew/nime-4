<p>The beauty of the siamese cat comes from the smoothness of their body and the amazing contrast between their body color and their eye color. Modern siamese cats are very different in appearance to those bred decades ago. These cats love the attention—human affection is one thing this breed can’t get enough of. The snowshoe siamese cat, initially known as �silver laces�, is a blend of a siamese and american shorthair. Siamese cats easily trust their owners and they do not take a long period to make a strong bond.</p>

<p>But there are few among their breed who are quite sensitive and also of nervous temperaments. The most noticeable feature of the siamese cat personality is the pointed color scheme. This is a cat who has a passion for his people and will involve himself in everything they are doing. This cat boasts of a unique coat that comes in various colors including the rare tortoiseshell appearance. Famous owners of siamese cats have included john lennon, syd barrett (who wrote a song inspired by his cat), james dean, and kesha.</p>

Siamese cats easily trust their owners and they do not take a long period to make a strong bond. But siamese cats are divided into many types, dictated by color and breeding.</p>

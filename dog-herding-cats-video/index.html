<p>Some herding dogs don’t live well with cats. That is the foundation instinct for border collie style herding. There are many forms of herding. As i have often found over the years, our herding dog’s behavior has a lot to do with breeding and instinct. Feel free to help improve this article or just check back in a few days to see if it�s expanded.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the popular border collie, star of the obedience ring and the agility circuit. At first, although admittedly i know better, i thought it was a bit funny. See more ideas about herding, working dogs, herding dogs. I first noticed the malfunctioning herding instinct on thanksgiving day as i watched the eukanuba dog show on tv and she began to pace and do what looked like a rain dance in my living room.

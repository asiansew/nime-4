<p>Insider rounded up 50 of the funniest, most searing movie reviews ever written. An adaptation of andrew lloyd webber’s thoroughly odd 1981 musical, itself an adaptation of a curious set of children’s. It has funny scenes, sad scenes, and some pretty dark stuff. The movie is apparently awful, so awful in fact that cats reviews have crossed over from being critical to being hilarious. They might be the best part of the whole thing:</p>

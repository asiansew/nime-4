<p>An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high. While this could be true to some extent, it doesn’t make black and white cats that much different from other cats of the same breed. I’ve also seen white cats with green eyes or gold eyes who are also deaf. The roll of the genetic dice that produces a white. Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article). Cats, however, often have eyes that look very pale blue, pink, or red.</p>

<p>And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. I’ve also seen white cats with green eyes or gold eyes who are also deaf. Many (but not all) white cats are deaf. White cats with blue eyes often suffer from a genetic defect that causes their cochlea, a vital organ within the inner ear, to degenerate shortly after birth.white cats with eyes of other colours can usually hear. But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them.</p>

<p>It sounds like yours clearly are not totally deaf, since you have plenty of examples of them responding to sound. Interestingly, if a white cat with one blue eye is deaf in only one ear, that ear will invariably be on the same side of the head as the blue eye. The gene responsible is pleiotropic. Still, look at it this way: But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them.</p>

<p>Coat color and an aspect of the cat’s personality or another aspect of anatomy can be linked if the gene that dictates the cat’s colour and a gene which affects the way the brain develops are situated close together on the same chromosome. Cats, however, often have eyes that look very pale blue, pink, or red. The deafness is caused by degeneration of the auditory apparatus of the inner ear and may affect one ear (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Still, look at it this way: In cats, congenital deafness is seen almost exclusively in white coated individuals.</p>

A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. Blue eyed cats are more often deaf than white cats with other coloured eyes. Certainly, if you have or see a white cat with blue eyes, i’d check for deafness, but don’t expect it because it’s.</p>

<p>It has to do with a genetic trait in all white cats. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high. Around 40% of cats with white fur and blue eyes are deaf. Accordingly, white or lightly colored cats often have light eyes.</p>

<p>40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf; Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear. But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them.

<p>An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Around 40% of cats with white fur and blue eyes are deaf. Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises.</p>

But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them. However, some are just partially deaf, or just deaf in one ear. While 40% of white cats with blue eyes are deaf it still means 60% are not, so you should not assume a cat is deaf just because their eyes are blue and their coat is white.</p>

<p>However, some are just partially deaf, or just deaf in one ear. Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Cats with just one deaf ear may appear perfectly normal, and their problem may never become known to their human companions. Blue eyed white cats do have a higher risk of being deaf than other cats, but they�re not all deaf.</p>

White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. While there is no truth that all white cats with blue eyes are deaf, science has proven that the number of deaf cats with at least one blue eye, is high.</p>

<p>My veterinarian said white cats are often deaf. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear. The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye.</p>

<p>White cats commonly have blue eyes or reddish eyes in the case of albinos. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. The deafness is caused by degeneration of the auditory apparatus of the inner ear and may affect one ear (unilateral) or both (bilateral). About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss.</p>

<p>Accordingly, white or lightly colored cats often have light eyes. Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss. The deafness is caused by degeneration of the auditory apparatus of the inner ear and may affect one ear (unilateral) or both (bilateral). You could get her hearing tested, it�s called a baer test. However, some are just partially deaf, or just deaf in one ear.</p>

<p>Around 40% of cats with white fur and blue eyes are deaf. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; It has to do with a genetic trait in all white cats. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. While 40% of white cats with blue eyes are deaf it still means 60% are not, so you should not assume a cat is deaf just because their eyes are blue and their coat is white.</p>

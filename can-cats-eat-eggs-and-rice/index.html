<p>It is not uncommon for stray or feral cats to steal and eat them or eat those of birds while in the wild. Cats can eat plenty of human foods such as brown rice, meat, eggs, and vegetables. However, rice in moderate portions can help your cat�s digestion and give him the energy he needs to chase birds away from your window and jump on your countertops. An occasional taste of cooked boneless beef or brown rice can be an ok treat. Chicken and rice has been known as a savior for sick cats and if you are looking to balance out their tummy somewhat, this can be the perfect meal.</p>

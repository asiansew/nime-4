<p>Tigers are the heaviest cats found in the wild, but the subspecies differ strongly in size. One major difference between big cats and domestic cats is that lions and tigers and so forth are wild, but domestic cats (as opposed to feral cats) are domesticated. The panthera genus contains the main roaring cat types, also known as the big four — tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards. In 2008, snow leopards were added to this group, even though they don’t roar.

<p>Cats require a food and water bowl, a litter box, a few toys and scratching posts, and a brush for grooming. According to national geographic, jaguars are bigger and bulkier than leopards and can weigh up to 113 kg, compared with the 79 kg of leopard. Tigers come in a large range of sizes, but the biggest tigers are as big as lions. Jaguar, leopard, lion, and tiger all have an adapted larynx and a unique part of the throat called a hyoid apparatus which gives them the ability to make a deep, loud roaring sound. The wide distribution translates to a variety of prey availability and size, which dictates the size of the wild cat.</p>

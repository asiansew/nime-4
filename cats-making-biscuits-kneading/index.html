<p>Kneading the area to tamp down grass and brush and get rid of unwanted pests before lying down is an ancient instinct. “some people call it ‘making biscuits.’ Kneading is when a cat moves his feet back and forth rhythmically, kneading some invisible dough with his paws as he purrs away happily. Right, this kneading motion posture is very similar to the pose when we make muffins. The action looks like a fuzzy little baker.</p>

Now you know a little more about cat kneading, let’s now take a look at why cats knead.

<p>“kneading is a behavior that most cats will continue to do throughout their lives,” krieger says. Whatever you may call it, the adorable and somewhat baffling cat behavior of kneading often leaves many cat owners scratching their heads. Kneading is when a cat moves his feet back and forth rhythmically, kneading some invisible dough with his paws as he purrs away happily. Kneading (also referred to as making biscuits or the cha cha) is an activity common to all domestic cats whereby, when in a state of ease, they alternately push out and pull in their front paws, often alternating between right and left limbs. This beloved activity, which involves the cat pushing her paws in and out against a soft surface, has garnered many euphemisms over the years, such as “making biscuits,” but most cat parents are unaware of what the process actually means or achieves.</p>

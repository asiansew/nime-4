<p>Your cat will need regular vet checks, blood tests and monitoring at home. Hyperthyroidism can protect the kidneys in cats with chronic kidney disease (see below) and great care must be taken when treating a cat who has both hyperthyroidism and kidney disease (i know first hand because my cat died within two weeks of starting on hyperthyroid medication). In fact, 95% of cats with hyperthyroid disease are 10 years old or older. Hyperthyroidism is a very common condition in cats, especially over the age of ten years old. Felimazole (methimazole) is the only drug approved to treat the disease in cats.</p>

<p>Hyperthyroidism is the most common hormonal imbalance in senior cats. Also called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is caused by an increase in production of thyroid hormones (known as t3 and t4) from an enlarged thyroid gland in a cat’s neck. Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) in cats and dogs. Hyperthyroidism is the most common hormonal imbalance in senior cats. Gary brummet, the small animal primary care veterinarian at the university of illinois veterinary teaching hospital in urbana, sees several of these cases each year.</p>

<p>Senior cats are at a greater risk for developing hyperthyroidism than any other age group of cats. In fact, 95% of cats with hyperthyroid disease are 10 years old or older. This disease in cats results from a typically benign tumor in the thyroid gland. The thyroid glands are small structures, located halfway up the neck in cats, on either side of the windpipe, one on the left and one on the right. It is not contagious and is a hormonal condition, which can result in a range of fairly obscure symptoms in cats that can be challenging for cat owners to notice and assign.</p>

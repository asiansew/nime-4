<p>On the hotline, we do our best to describe each animal, but descriptions are subjective, and your animal may have been injured, lost weight, lost hair or look different from when you last saw it. We have several resources available to help you find your missing pet or reunite a lost pet with her family on your own. 11am to 4pm 7 days a week. The khs lost pet phone line is updated daily with the stray animals that were brought into kitsap humane society within the last 24 hours. Since not all all lost animals find their way to the inland valley humane society, we rely on the community to notify us if a pet is lost or found.</p>

<p>When most people pet a bengal for the first time, they immediately feel that there’s something different about their coats. The mau is a rare domestic cat breed that has spots on its coat. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. Many breeds on the top hypoallergenic breeds list require regular bathing anyway, but baths decrease loose hair where applicable, dander, oils, and saliva. This is mainly because these particular cats do produce fewer allergens than most other cats.</p>

<p>A bengal cat’s coat is exotic and low shedding. In the cat’s saliva, there is fel d1 protein, which usually makes an allergic person take antihistamines, sneeze, have itchy eyes, or even have an asthma attack. That is proven by the research of several universities that show siberian breed produces ten times less allergen compared to other domestic cats. Many breeds on the top hypoallergenic breeds list require regular bathing anyway, but baths decrease loose hair where applicable, dander, oils, and saliva. The allergen that is to blame for both severe and mild reactions to cats is something that every single cat produces, although, with some breeds, you won’t come in contact with the allergen as much.</p>

<p>The main cause of cat allergies is a protein called fel d1, which is present in cat dander (flakes of dead skin) and cat saliva. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. Here are the top 10 hypoallergenic cat breeds you need to know: One is because people who are severely allergic to cats will tend to have mild or no reactions at all to bengals especially in direct comparison to the bulk of the other breeds of cats.

<p>Well, truth be told, there actually are some cat breeds that do exist that might be considered to be somewhat “hypoallerginc” or low allergy cats. When most people pet a bengal for the first time, they immediately feel that there’s something different about their coats. Hypoallergenic cats refer to the breeds that are most unlikely to cause an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. This is believed to be the case for three main reasons:</p>

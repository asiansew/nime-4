<p>I�ve tried to do a little online research on this, but i can�t seem to find a consensus. They also make great cuddlers. Pictures, videos, articles and questions featuring and about cats. Vivid colors are hardly perceived by cat eyes. Dogs, cats, and rats can detect cancer, seizures, tuberculosis, bombs, and drugs, why not pregnancies?</p>

<p>But why is my cat scared all of a sudden? While the majority of cats aren�t hypersensitive to the venom found in bee or wasp stings, if your kitty falls into the minority of cats that are allergic, getting stung could make her seriously ill or go into anaphylactic shock. I know they are induced ovulators, so if an egg is fertilized, wouldn�t one hope the queen�s body would know to not allow it to grow if there are already other babies developing in there? If only humans had that kind of sense of smell, now that’s a pregnancy test! Are there any pregnancy symptoms 3 days past ovulation?</p>

<p>Despite all of the claims out there, it isn’t possible to have a period while you’re pregnant. An amazing cat has earned the admiration of animal lovers on reddit after it was filmed “coming to the rescue” of a struggling kitten. 200 million scent cells are found in a cat’s nose — a huge difference from the 5 million scent cells in a human ‘s nose. It was a tough and challenging time for us. Populations of birds, small mammals, and other local wildlife can be decimated by the presence of cats.</p>

Bengal cats are lots of fun. A bengal cat’s personality is quite different from other cat breeds owing to certain distinctive features like their love for water, affectionate temperament, and their friendly behavior towards other pets (even dogs) and children.</p>

<p>If something is happening, a bengal will be checking that something out. But do not be afraid, the bengal cat has a really affectionate temperament! Bengal cats have inherited not only their feral appearance but also their inquisitive personality from asian leopard cats. Bengal cats love to climb and like their wild, jungle dwelling cousins, they seek high vantage points from which to view their domain. The bengal is highly active and highly intelligent.</p>

<p>Bengal cats are hybrids of domestic cats and asian leopard cats. Plus, they�re cute and, unlike larger, exotic cats, they probably can�t cause any super serious injuries to humans. Depending on the cat, they enjoy more than just batting at water, they like getting in it and swimming, as well. Not only be around though but also try to participate and be as physical as possible with whatever it is that you’re doing. Bengal cat owners often find it interesting to observe their kitty opening a door or a cabinet.</p>

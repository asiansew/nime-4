<p>1.10 can cats eat tomatoes? Mix between one and four teaspoons of canned pumpkin with cat food one to two times a day. My kitten had diarrhea, possibly from gorging himself on wet food (not all cats have the ability to free feed wet food), so i started making him cat food from organic turkey baby food puree and canned pumpkin, with a little omega 3 fish oil, and his stool firmed up within a few hours!! A dog food diet does not meet the specific nutritional needs that cats require. 1.7 can cats eat asparagus?</p>

<p>I needed to force her. Though the pumpkin comes in a can and has less sugar we just started with a really low amount and slowly increased the amount of pumpkin mixed in. If your cat needs a little extra fiber in his diet, stir some pumpkin or squash puree into his food. Bengal cats are extremely allergic to garlic and ginger. Is pumpkin good for hamsters?</p>

<p>Cats do not meow to other cats, they meow to humans because they have learned they will get things/attention when they do it. “humidifiers and steam can help loosen mucus and make nasal breathing easier.” If a cat ‘‘asks’’ to enter your house or meows at the door, it is very likely that it is looking for a safe refuge. If human owners are sleeping, they are not available to provide comfort. And yes, they do meow very loud at times but this seems to be a behavior of the adult male cats only. Pay attention to your cat and what else is happening while it�s crying.</p>
<h3 id="a-cat-who-meows-a-lot-should-be-checked-thoroughly-by-a-veterinarian-to-ensure-a-medical-condition-is-not-the-cause-of-the-cats-distress">A cat who meows a lot should be checked thoroughly by a veterinarian to ensure a medical condition is not the cause of the cat’s distress.</h3><p>Kittens mewing, kittens squeaking, kittens meowing, kittens purring, hilarious kitten videos, funny kittens, cute kittens, fluffy kittens, orange. Intact male cats never lose the urge to procreate. Some breeds, such as siamese, are known to be naturally noisy, but any cat can meow loudly for a number of reasons. The cat is making its concerns known and seeking reassurance. Numerous diseases can cause cats to feel unusually hungry, thirsty, restless or irritable—any of which is likely to prompt meowing. A second cat is one way to provide night time attention, but it can be difficult to predict whether the two animals will get along.</p>

<p>The cat is making its concerns known and seeking reassurance. If human owners are sleeping, they are not available to provide comfort. And some cats just seem to like to hear their own voices, while others seem to want to carry on a conversation with their owners. As you might expect, respiratory infections in cats make it difficult for a cat to breathe, which could cause panting. Of course, the amount of meowing varies by breed and even cat.</p>

<p>My cats never do that. They use some squeaks, meows, hisses, and purrs to communicate with each other. But the cats meowing loudly is mainly towards humans. I saw 2 cats outside an apt building just stading face to face meowing really loudly and for a long time. Older cats often meow more because of failing senses or due to anxiety over not being as nimble as before.</p>

<p>One meows and they other one meows even louder. Since there are several reasons why cats meow, i thought i would cover a few of them. Oriental breeds, especially siamese cats, are known as great “talkers,” so anyone who doesn’t like meowing probably should steer clear of these breeds. Cats make all kinds of sounds.some feline vocalizations are pleasant for us, like purrs, trills and meows.others are annoying or downright alarming, as in the case with cat yowling.

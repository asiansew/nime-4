<p>So even in a bright room, the eyes stay dilated. The vet may also test the production of tears. Unequal pupils, or anisocoria, occurs when one of a cat’s pupils is either too far open or too far closed in relation to the other pupil. This problem not only affects cats, since it can also occur in other animals, including humans. They may check the blinking reflexes, how well the cat follows an object, and how sensitive the pupils are to light.</p>

<p>In some cases, the abnormal pupil may be the one that is smaller and in other cases the abnormal pupil may be the one that is larger. Dilated (large) pupils are another source of understanding the meaning of cats’ mysterious eyes, and often indicate an excited cat. My cat�s eyes appear to have become more dilated slowly over the last 6 months. The vet may also test the production of tears. The vet may start by checking your cat’s eyes and pupils.</p>

<p>This means that in the early stages of illness, often the only thing that a cat owner may notice is that the cat has become quiet and withdrawn.

<p>When frisky is very playful or feeling stressed, her pupils can become very large to reflect her feelings. Many things could cause anisocoria in your cat. While most cats’ eyes glow bright green, a siamese’s eyes glow more yellow. Anisocoria refers to a medical condition of unequal pupil size where one of a cat�s pupils is smaller than the other. It took her almost three days to shake off the effects of the drugs used on her when she was spayed, while it took her sisters and cousins only a few hours (they were all altered on the same afternoon by the same vet).</p>

<p>Glaucoma is another common cause for differing pupil size in cats. Is this a symptom of something more serious? Osara was sprawled on the floor and i glanced at her eyes and while one pupil was slightly more constricted than usual, the other was almost fully dilated. Though eye disease is less common in cats than dogs, you should rush to the vet as soon as you can if your cat’s eye or eyes appear cloudy. Webmd symptom checker helps you find the most common medical conditions indicated by the symptoms enlarged (dilated) pupils and unequal pupils (size) including eye injury, normal variation, and cocaine abuse.</p>

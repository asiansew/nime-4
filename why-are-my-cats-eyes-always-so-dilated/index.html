<p>My cat was injured 2 months ago and from the injury her right pupil is always dilated. I’ve never seen his pupils be in a skinny like my other cats, he always has them big and round. Cats die with their eyes open. She�s quite a shy kitten but is really affectionate towards me so i don�t think it�s out of fear or anger. My cat (just a year old) has been sick for the last few months with several injuries which required sutures.</p>

<p>Apparently it�s fairly common in fiv cats. Many cats “hide” when they are sick.this is a defensive mechanism to prevent predators from spotting them in a vulnerable state. The size of your pupils is controlled by muscles in the colored part of your eye and the amount of light reaching your eyes. Glaucoma in cats is a disease that involves increased pressure of fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). I’ve never seen his pupils be in a skinny like my other cats, he always has them big and round.</p>

<p>Dilated pupils are pupils that are larger than normal in size. Her eyes are literally always dilated when she�s in the house. I never had second thoughts about it because i got her when i was 5 so i never think about anything wrong with her since i�m so used to it. She�s 12 weeks old and i�ve had her for about a month. This will usually be either anger, pleasure or fear.</p>

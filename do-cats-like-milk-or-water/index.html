<p>Some cats like having ice in their drinking water, especially during the scorching summer months. Do the extra glands in the top of their mouths make fish irresistible? They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset stomach. Both they and us need calcium, or we�ll get a deficiency. Cats do like milk, but, like all animals, feeding them milk will make the very, very sick.</p>

<p>Why do cats like milk? The two things are not really related. For adult cats, treat milk replacers like any other dairy product: Also, when cats get up in their senior years, they tend to. Cats do like milk, but, like all animals, feeding them milk will make the very, very sick.</p>

<p>If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they like it. There�s little reason to force a cat to do something it doesn�t want to do. Plenty of cats have zero interest in interacting with h2o outside their water bowl, but there are breeds that are more likely to enjoy water than others. As long as your cats don’t eat the ice, you can give it to them as a treat from time to time Cats generally not need to be bathed, and should only be bathed if they�ve gotten into something especially dirty or toxic.</p>

<p>Can dogs eat beef bones? Cannot be fed to dogs or cats without substantially increasing the risk of injury. On the one hand, natural, unprocessed pork bones are okay for your pooch. As an alternative to chicken, beef or lamb, cats can eat a small portion of pork or ham as long as it’s cooked through and any bones are removed. This more commonly affects humans than dogs.</p>

<p>Cats come from an ancient line of hunters and are obligate carnivores. Keep her well away from anything you even suspect may be toxic for cats. The rind is the skin of a pig. Just like with any other cooked bones, when it comes to letting dogs eat pork bones cooked, the answer is a resounding no way. Bones can also splinter and cause an obstruction or cut the inside of your cat�s digestive system.</p>

<p>As explained above no cat is truly hypoallergenic. He is a minimal shedder and is ideal for people with. Siamese cats are not hypoallergenic. However, as the siamese is not a heavy shedder, this breed could be a good pick for someone who is usually allergic to cats.

<p>So it’s not surprising that there is a high demand for hypoallergenic cats. These cats shed very less as they have short hairs and you will love them as they will not shed much inside the house. This is actually a defect so most breeders will select against this. Physically, there are no real features in this breed of cat that might make you suspect it will be ‘hypoallergenic’. It’s worth noting that a lot of the cats on the list are relatives of the siamese.</p>

<p>Physically, there are no real features in this breed of cat that might make you suspect it will be ‘hypoallergenic’. When people think of hypoallergenic cats, the first one they tend to bring up is the sphynx. Often referred to as the “longhaired siamese,” the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed. Unfortunately, this includes our friend the siamese. Did we mention that these hypoallergenic cats are pretty adorable, too?</p>

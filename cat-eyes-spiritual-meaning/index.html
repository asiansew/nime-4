Cat’s eyes are excellent gleaners of light! The cat has been a symbol of independence, beauty and affection for ages. Cat’s medicine includes independence, unpredictability, healing, curiosity, many lives, magic, mystery, cleverness, the ability to fight when cornered, seeing the unseen, allows us to dream its dreams and protection.</p>

<p>If a cat ‘‘asks’’ to enter your house or meows at the door, it is very likely that it is looking for a safe refuge. Cat eyes can come in a variety of colors. It is also called as a future predicting gemstone. it is useful to separate a right choice and a bad choice. I believe this deep spiritual meaning of cat dream will expose you. As its name shows, cat�s eye stone is a gemstone that has a shine looks like a cat�s eye.</p>

<p>There’s something about a cat’s eyes that make you feel like it can see right through you. This is often due to a superstition formed around mysterious, unusual, or even feral feline behavior. When t he stone is moved slightly, a narrow strip of light passes over its surface, looking very much like an eye of cat (hence its name). I believe this deep spiritual meaning of cat dream will expose you. To dream of a golden leopard colored feline indicates that you need to nurture your inner adventurist.</p>

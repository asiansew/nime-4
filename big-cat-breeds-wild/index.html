<p>A domestic cat that looks like a tiger or an african wild cat, the bengal is a popular hybrid cat that actually has wild cats as part of their breeding program. This means that, unlike the domestic house cat (felis catus), which has had over 9000 years of close contact with humans, and has been selectively bred over centuries for adaption to such a lifestyle, wild cat breeds have lived only a few generations with people. The largest big cat is the siberian tiger, which can weigh an astonishing 660 pounds and stretch more than 10 feet nose to tail. Many large cat breeds are cuddly companions for every member of the family. The bengal cat has the appearance of a leopard and is generally a big fan of water.</p>

<p>While the tiger’s distribution range stretches from siberia to sumatra, most of the world’s remaining tigers occur in india. We all know about the wild cats such as lions, tigers, cougars, leopards and even jaguars, but there�s a whole world of small and big cats out there, especially a bunch of rare cat breeds that you�ve probably never heard of! Some do exist, however, including those with big cat ancestors. But there are also wild cat breeds that combine these two types, bringing together the wild aesthetic and nature and combining it with the domesticity of the house cats that we all know and love so much. What i mean is that one of these wild cats will probably be expunged from mexico at some time in the future.</p>

Yesterday i noticed a few drops of blood on the floor. Lack of eating for even a few days can lead to a serious problem called fatty liver or hepatic lipidosis. Kittens receive anesthesia when they are spayed or neutered, and most pets receive anesthesia at least once more during their lifetimes. Regarding vaccinations, yes, cats (especially those that spend time outside with stray, unvaccinated cats) need to be tested first, for fiv (feline aids) and felv (feline leukemia virus), and if those test results are negative the cat will be vaccinated against those diseases, plus, feline rhinotracheitis (cat flu), and distemper.</p>

<p>These breeds are those with a shortened muzzle such as persians, himalayans, and exotic shorthairs. I am making taking him to the vet soon.

<p>Kittens receive anesthesia when they are spayed or neutered, and most pets receive anesthesia at least once more during their lifetimes. Keeps her head down and eyes slit, won�t come out of the carrier or is otherwise hiding is very likely in severe pain, especially if she just underwent abdominal surgery (including a spay). She can continue nursing, even after spay, and the kittens can be trapped and spayed/neutered, once they are 12 weeks old.

<p>After the cats are fixed, release them at the location where you found them. Gooey eyes can mean bacterial complications, watery eyes can mean viral, neither should be ignored imo. If your cat�s eyes are normal today and bulging tomorrow, glaucoma is the most likely suspect. Some interventions can however help to speed up recovery. Neutered males can still get female cats that haven’t been fixed pregnant up to 30 days after the procedure.</p>

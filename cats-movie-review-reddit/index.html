<p>Cats is terrible, in my opinion, for totally mundane reasons that have nothing to do with the cats or the bad cgi: Attention, moviegoers searching for the worst movie of the year: Cats the movie, penned by lee hall and hooper, helpfully reiterates this in a new scene between two characters, just in case the digital fur and all the cavorting distracts you from the plot. Best horror film of the year! being back in my hometown for the holidays (which has like, one bar, by the way) has led me to a new favorite hobby: But no, cats is far from the worst movie of the decade, much less the year.</p>

<p>The reviews ranged from critiques about the absolute madness of the production to confusion over the choice. Taylor swift�s disney+ doc is just her singing in a barn, and that�s ok. It was not as interestingly bad as i expected. The big screen adaptation of cats had its review embargo lift yesterday and critics aren�t exactly pleased with what they saw. I wanted to watch a unique kind of bad movie, the love child of a bad trip and a dumpster fire.</p>

<p>Ignore the haters, enjoy the music and dancing. The cats movie is weird as heck, but our reviewer absolutely loved it on its own terms. The review embargo for the upcoming movie adaptation of cats, directed by tom hooper, lifted on wednesday night and critics all across the internet have been coughing up furballs. In that department, this version of cats has been declawed. Cats slips in right under the radar and easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel — and.</p>

<p>The reviews for cats are pretty forthright. Iain armitage is giving cats a rave review!. Cats functions more like an anthology of songs and musical theater numbers than it does as an intricate or compelling story. This leaves a film with a lot of signing and dancing, a lacklustre plot and limited dialogue, as the movie crams a alwebber�s cats was a hugely popular stage show on the west end, broadway, and around the world. Thank god cats the movie has stayed true to cats the musical.</p>

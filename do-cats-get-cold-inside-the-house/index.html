<p>Especially if the owner out and the heating is switched off You should look out for the signs that your cat is showing you that he’s cold. Obviously, a cat’s temperature fluctuates. In cold temperatures, your cat will feel much colder than we do therefore, we need to take some action to help kitty get some warmth. I suspect the problem is the large dog that has moved in over the fence.</p>

<p>Get some citrus essential oil and mix it up in a small spray bottle. As science explains, a cat will automatically become slightly cooler while sleeping. This is due to a few factors but primarily your cat’s coat. The most important is to keep your cat indoors. Cats can adapt well to cold weather but if it goes below freezing then you’re asking for trouble.</p>

<p>One of our 7 year old female cats has started pooing in the bath. They prefer to stay out of the cold and in the heat whenever possible. If the weather is bitter cold or snowing keep your pets inside. Feline colds are known as upper respiratory infections. Yes, your cat can indeed catch a cold, but not the kind that you or i might catch, although it may look like the same thing.</p>

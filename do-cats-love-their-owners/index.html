A study published monday finds that cats see their owners as a source of comfort and security, too. And those that love their feline friends really love them. While your cat does trust you they also want to keep warm and they love the heat from their humans. The joy, relaxation and contentment that is felt by kittens when they are being fed also extends to adult cats, who continue kneading as a way to showcase their love when they grow older.</p>

<p>Cats learn specifically how their owners react when they make particular noises. In fact, 65% of both the kitten group and the adult cat group were found to form secure attachments to their owners. Also, this same research has seen a similar attachment when compared to babies to their mothers. Once cats are weaned from their mother and are brought into a human household, what you choose to do next makes a big difference in how your cat will respond to you throughout their life. They are directly opposed to dogs, which are treated as animals faithful by nature, and capable of givi.</p>

<p>Cats do love their owners. Domestic cats share far more dna with their wild cousins than pet dogs do with wolves, so our feline friends may need a boost to help them bond with another species. They found that cats have the capacity to form attachments to their caregivers in the same way that children and dogs do. Cats love us even when we’re down. “this study shows that cats do not need their humans to feel safe, they don’t depend on us, they look after themselves.</p>

<p>Some so strong that cats have traveled hundreds or thousands of miles through places they’ve never been to find their owners. How they tested cat bonding. Many cats love their owners just as much, if not more than we love them and they like to show it. Though they don’t always display their affection in the same ways that we do, they do try to demonstrate their love through their own love language. My cats will actively follow me around even when sleeping somewhere they would otherwise stay for hours.</p>

<p>Is yes, and it is finally scientifically proven that cats also love humans or their owners, but not as much as dogs. Once cats are weaned from their mother and are brought into a human household, what you choose to do next makes a big difference in how your cat will respond to you throughout their life. In a study from emory university, scientists trained dogs to lie still in an mri machine and used fmri (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure how their brains responded to the scents of both familiar and unfamiliar people and dogs, mic reports. “this study shows that cats do not need their humans to feel safe, they don’t depend on us, they look after themselves. Those that don’t (generally dog people), however, claim cats are selfish creatures who show no affection and think they’re better.</p>

<p>I purchased a flocked christmas tree during christmas in july, on sale. However, if by some unfortunate event they do, the worst that can happen is needles to lodge in your kitten’s intestines. No, christmas trees are not toxic to family pets. Are christmas trees poisonous to dogs and cats? Real christmas trees are potentially more dangerous to your cat than artificial ones.</p>

<p>There’s nothing quite like heading out on a chilly. The oils produced by some real christmas trees are also mildly toxic if consumed, causing minor irritation to a pet’s mouth and stomach. Since i have both dogs and cats in my family, lack of toxicity is a very important factor in my decision to buy a houseplant. The fir tree oil, if consumer by your cat, can cause mouth and stomach irritation. Securing it to a wall with some wire near the top can help keep it upright.</p>

<p>Christmas trees can be dangerous for dogs and cats if your pets consume their needles or ornaments, drink the tree water or chew on the christmas tree lights. If you have a cat, which shows an interest in chewing your christmas cactus and displays any of the above symptoms we recommend you move the plant to an area (or room) your cat can’t access. She tells petcha that needles can puncture intestines, and an artificial tree�s needles can cause an intestinal blockage. Ingesting pine needles can cause liver damage or even death, according to cat behavior expert marilyn krieger. Philippe huguen/afp via getty images</p>

<p>Securing it to a wall with some wire near the top can help keep it upright. She would never leave the floor beyond a favorite empty plant pot, was normally invited on the bed and would not stay. Real christmas trees are potentially more dangerous to your cat than artificial ones. The holly dazzle tree cats love to climb into the tree and peer out at everyone from their new safe hiding spot. Obviously, this is painful and can be dangerous.</p>

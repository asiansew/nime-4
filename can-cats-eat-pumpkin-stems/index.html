<p>This recipe from petnet is favorite among kitties who love apples and pumpkin. Never feed a cat pumpkin skins or stems, and never feed them too much. Stems on faux pumpkins has not been easy for me. It is one of the main ingredients in many cat food recipes. However, be aware that apple needs to be prepared properly before cats can eat them safely.</p>

<p>Pumpkin seeds are high in antioxidants, and they can be a tasty treat for your dog to eat. They include many plants like deadly nightshade and contain a bitter. It’s important to offer no more than about an inch of pumpkin leaf or stem at a time since these treats are high in calcium. Peas, which are often included in pet food, are full of fiber. The shelf life for dry, roasted pumpkin seeds is less than a month.</p>

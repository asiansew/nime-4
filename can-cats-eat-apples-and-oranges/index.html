<p>So many of us want to know is there any reverse or anti for cats and apples and can cats have apples or not. Any of these can cause vomiting or diarrhea. Since apples are fruits, you will not find any proteins in it. They may eat the entire apple, including the seeds, and will throw any of the unfinished fruit on the ground which can attract deer and other animals. Lemons, oranges and limes are all unhealthy for cats, as are the fruit, peelings and seeds of grapefruit.</p>

<p>The fleshy fruit of apricots can make a good treat for cats and dogs. This isnât a matter of nutrition. Cats are meat eaters and do not wish to hunt fruit. They may eat the entire apple, including the seeds, and will throw any of the unfinished fruit on the ground which can attract deer and other animals. However, some vegetables or fruits can not only be delicious but also provide a high nutritional content.</p>

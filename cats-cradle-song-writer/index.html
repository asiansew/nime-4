<p>Cats in the cradle is a 1974 folk rock song by harry chapin from the album verities &amp; balderdash. He sang a song on the scaffold. Cats cradle is one of the oldest games in recorded human history, and involves creating various string figures, either individually or by passing a loop of string back and forth between two or more players. The song was intended to be a poem, but its deep lyrics and smooth rhythms led it to become one of the most successful rock songs of its time. The song is called, “cat’s in the cradle”.</p>

<p>�cat�s in the cradle� was a combination of a couple of things. Although he recorded a number of hits from 1972 to 1981, chapin is best remembered for “cat’s in the cradle.” the song is actually taken from a poem harry’s wife sandy wrote. I�ve often thought somebody ought to do a book about him sometime. He learned to walk while i was away. “cat’s in the cradle” is about the children of the 50’s, the people whom i grew up with … and if you believe in this song, our lives went sideways, out the window, and ended up standing on the same front step, looking over the same lawn, thinking the same thoughts, while becoming the a mirrored image of our parents.</p>

He sang a song he�d composed for the occasion. what was the song about? you can find the words over at the historical society, if you�re really interested.. Cat�s cradle is the fourth novel by american writer kurt vonnegut, first published in 1963.it explores issues of science, technology, and religion, satirizing the arms race and many other targets along the way. My child arrived just the other day.</p>

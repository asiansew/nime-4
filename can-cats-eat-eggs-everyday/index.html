<p>Are raw eggs good for dogs? For the same reasons we humans don’t eat raw eggs, your cat shouldn’t eat them as well. There are many situations where eggs can be harmful to cats. Although eggs are wonderfully nutritious, they do not contain complete and balanced nutrition for a cat. Can cats eat raw eggs?</p>

<p>So, the protein and amino acids in eggs are good for cats. The answer to that question is yes, cats can eat eggs in moderation, though you must ask your veterinarian before you feed eggs to your cat. Eggs offer the same nutritional value for puppies as they do for adult dogs. You may be wondering if your dog can also eat the egg shell. But still an egg isn’t a perfect meal for her.</p>

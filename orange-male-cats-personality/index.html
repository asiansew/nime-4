<p>Future studies can investigate whether. Like being stroked, but dislike being picked up and cuddled.” a 1973 book published by pedigree foods described ginger tabbies as “quiet, docile and affectionate.” in a recent study at the university of california, cat owners were asked to attribute personality traits to their cats. All orange cats have stripe patterns, however faint. The gene that codes for orange fur is on the x chromosome. Well, that’s not entirely true.</p>

<p>According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names. All orange cats are tabbies, but all tabbies are not orange. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger, whereas males need only one. Orange cats can have long or short hair. The same study about human perception of a cat�s personality due to their coat color also discusses white cats.they are seen as “less bold and active and more shy and calm than other colors of cat”.</p>

<p>Once flea eggs are laid., they’ll fall onto the carpet. No they do not lay eggs. Your hens will normally lay eggs because this is what their body is intended to do. Since the egg is entirely animal protein, this is a safe thing for them to eat. Can a chicken lay eggs without a rooster or is it a myth?</p>

<p>The next factor to consider is the environment. Cats can absolutely eat eggs that are hard boiled. Can male chickens lay eggs? No they do not lay eggs. There is only one flea to an egg but bering in mind a female flea will lay about.</p>

<p>How to handle cats� meowing. Common complaints when an old cat meows all the time. Depending on the breed, some cats, such as siamese, naturally will meow louder and more frequently than others. As the health problems above indicate, panting in cats could signify a serious disorder. Sometimes though, meows simply serve as a “welcome home” salutation.</p>

<p>Depending on the breed, some cats, such as siamese, naturally will meow louder and more frequently than others. There are health issues that can prompt excess meowing. Your cat may approach you with its favorite toy and meow, seeking your immediate attention. A cat yowling in your face gets that food bowl refilled. Older cats often meow more because of failing senses or due to anxiety over not being as nimble as before.</p>

<p>There are health issues that can prompt excess meowing. “adult cats developed meowing specifically to communicate with humans. In other words, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Meowing however is a language developed exclusively for humans. Night calling can be a confusing and frustrating behavior if you don’t know why your cat is doing it.</p>

<p>Living outdoors also leads to many dangerous and unpredictable situations for stray cats, from being run over by rapidly speeding cars to nonstop violent altercations with other animals (especially when it comes to tomcats). Just to be clear, this article is not about a cat who “talks” to you, meows a lot or is purring loudly. Cats are crepuscular creatures, however, meaning they are most active at dusk and dawn. Cats that have not been spayed may yowl because they are in heat. The only time meowing may be a form of communication between cats is when cats in heat meow loudly to get a mate�s attention.</p>
